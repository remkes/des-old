    <p>
      First order linear equation have the following general form.
      <me>
        a(t) \frac{dy}{dt} + b(t) y = f(t)
      </me>
      Here <m>a(t)</m>, <m>b(t)</m> and <m>f(t)</m> are various
      (usually continuous) functions. If I avoid the values where
      <m>a(t) = 0</m>, I can divide by <m>a(t)</m> to isolate the
      derivative, giving the following more typical form. (Remember
      the denominators! I have to pay attention to the roots of
      <m>a(t)</m> throughout the solution, since they indicate values
      of <m>t</m> where the solutions might not exist or might not
      have the expected behaviour.)
      <me>
        \frac{dy}{dt} + P(t) y = Q(t)
      </me>
      This will be the standard form for the analysis that I will
      present. To solve equations in this standard form, I work by
      steps. The first steps is to solve a related but easier equation
      called the homogeneous equation.

          A first order linear DE, written in the standard form, is

      A homogeneous first order linear DE is relatively easy to solve
      as a separable equation. I'll use the standard method for
      solving a separable equation.

      I should make a couple of notes about this calculation.
    </p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>
        I use the previous mentioned informal carelessness to make the
        constant easy to deal with. When I take exponents of each side
        of the equation, I should have multiplication by <m>e^c</m>.
        However, since this is still an undetermined constant, I
        simply write <m>c</m> instead of <m>e^c</m>. Also, when I
        drop the absolute value bars from <m>y</m>, we should have a
        <sq><m>\pm</m></sq>. Again, since <m>c</m> can be either positive
        or negative, I don't worry about that <m>\pm</m> <mdash />
        it's all captured in this constant which will be determined by
        the initial conditions.
      </li>
      <li>
        I had a <m>y</m> in the denominator for this process, which
        means that I have to be careful at points where <m>y=0</m>. I
        would need to use limits to figure out behaviour when <m>y</m>
        gets close to zero.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <m>P</m> is constant, this is just the basic percentage
        growth equation with solution <m>y = ce^{-\alpha t}</m>. If
        <m>\alpha</m> is positive, this is decay, and if <m>\alpha</m>
        is negative, this is growth. 
      </li>

    <title>Linear Operators and Superposition</title>
    <p>
      Now I know how to approach homogeneous equations and I'm going
      to use this to approach the general linear DE. However, before
      doing so, I want ton introduce some very useful tools and
      terminology.  Recall from <xref
      ref="definition-linear-differential-operator" /> the idea of
      differential operators.  If I write <m>L = \frac{d}{dt} +
      P(t)</m>, then I can use the differential operator to write a
      linear equation in a very simple form. 
      <me>
        L y = Q(t)
      </me>.
      This <m>L</m> is a <em>linear</em> differential operator, so it
      behaves linearly, that is, it has the two linearity properties.
      (In linear algebra language, it is a linear transformation.
      Only, now, instead of being a transformation sending vectors to
      vectors, it is a transformation sending functions to functions.)
      <md>
        <mrow>  
          L(y_1 + y_2) \amp = Ly_1 + Ly_2
        </mrow>
        <mrow>  
          L(cy) \amp = cL(y)
        </mrow>
      </md>
      Now consider both the homoegenous equation <m>Ly = 0</m> and a
      non-homogenous equation <m>Ly = Q(t)</m>. If <m>f</m> is a
      solution to the non-homogenous equation, then <m>Lf = Q(t)</m>,
      and if <m>g</m> is a solution to the homogenous equation, then
      <m>Lg = 0</m>. Now I can use linearity to calculate what
      happens when I apply the operator <m>L</m> to the sum <m>f +
      \alpha g</m>, for any real number <m>\alpha</m>. 
      <me>
        L(f+\alpha g) = Lf + \alpha Lg = Q(t) + \alpha \cdot 0 = Q(t)
      </me>
      Let me write this in general and use it for a definition.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f</m> is a solution to a non-homogenous first order
          linear DE <m>Ly=Q(t)</m> and <m>g</m> is a solution to the
          homogeneous equation <m>Ly = 0</m>, then all other solutions
          to the non-homogeneous equaiton are formed by adding
          multiples of <m>g</m> to <m>f</m>. The solution <m>f</m> to
          <m>Ly = Q(t)</m> is called the <term>particular
          solution</term> and this process of using linearity to
          create more solutions is called <term>superposition of
          solutions</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Again using linear algebra language, the solutions of a linear
      equation form an affine subspace since they can be expressed as
      an offset span. The non-homogenous solution is the offset and
      the basis of the span is any homogenous solution. Superposition
      constructs this offset span structure. The total space in which
      this linear space lives is the <sq>vector space</sq> of
      differentiable functions. This is an infinite dimensional
      vector space (uncountably infinite, even), so it is a strange
      object compared with <m>\RR^n</m>. But the language of linear
      algebra still applies and gives very concise and convenient
      description of things like sets of solutions.

      Homogeneous linear differential equations are solvable since
      there are separable. I did this above. With the understanding of
      superposition, then, to solve a non-homogeneous linear
      differential equation, I just need to find one particular
      solution. To do this, I need a new technique.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>L = \frac{d}{dt} + Q(t)</m> be as before, and let
      <m>y_h</m> be a homogeneous solutions (a solution to <m>Ly =
      0</m>). The technique I  will use is called <term>variation of
      parameters</term>. This technique says I should look for a
      particular solution of the type <m>y_p = g(t) y_h</m>. (This is
      part of a very general strategy in solving differential
      equations: make some kind of reasonable guess for what form the
      solution should take then investigate that form.) Using this
      assuming, I have to try to find the new function <m>g(t)</m>.
      In order to do that, I put my assumed solution <m>g(t) y_h</m>
      into the equation and do some manipulations. 
      <me>  
        Ly_p(t) = L g(t) y_h(t) = Q(t)
      </me>
      I need to use the product rule to differentiate <m>g(t) y_h</m>
      when I apply the differential operator to the left side
      <me>  
        g^\prime(t) y_h(t) + g(t) y_h^\prime(t) + g(t) P(t) y_h(t) =
        Q(t)
      </me>
      I can factor <m>g(t)</m> out of two terms.
      <me>  
        g^\prime(t) y_h(t) + g(t) \Big( y_h^\prime(t) + P(t) y_h(t) \Big)
        = Q(t)
      </me>
      The expression inside the brackets is precisely the differential
      operator <m>L</m> applied to <m>y_h(t)</m>. 
      <me>  
        g^\prime(t) y_h(t) + g(t) L y_h = Q(t)
      </me>
      Since <m>y_h</m> is the homogeneous solution, <m>L y_h = 0</m>. 
      <me>  
        g^\prime(t) y_h(t) + g(t) 0 = Q(t)
      </me>
      Now I can solve for <m>g^\prime(t)</m>.
      <me>  
        g^\prime(t) = \frac{Q(t)}{y_h(t)}
      </me>
      Then I can integrate to find <m>g(t)</m>. 
      <me>  
        g(t) = \int \frac{Q(t)}{y_h(t)}
      </me>
      Now I have an expression for <m>g(t)</m>. Let me write
      <m>y_p</m> using this <m>g(t)</m>. 
      <me>  
          y_p = g(t) y_h = \left( \int \frac{Q(t)}{e^{-\int P(t) dt}}
          dt \right) y_h
      </me>
      If I want, I can use the fact that the homogeneous solution is
      <m>y = e^{-\int P(t)dt}</m> to write all of <m>y_p</m> in terms
      of <m>Q(t)</m> and <m>P(t)</m>.
      <me>  
        y_p = \left( \int \frac{Q(t)}{e^{-\int P(t) dt}} dt \right)
        e^{-\int P(t) dt } = e^{-\int P(t) dt} \int e^{\int P(t) dt}
        Q(t) dt
      </me>
      This is a complete solution, and the presentation I've given is
      the most general presentation and introduces the useful idea of
      variation of parameters. However, there is a slightly different
      presentation of the same solution which is common is the
      literature and turns out to be more efficient for actually
      solving these DEs. It involves the following definition.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          In solving a linear equation of the form <m>\frac{dy}{dt} +
          P(t) y = Q(t)</m>, the expression <m>e^{\int P(t) dt}</m> is
          called an <term>integrating factor</term> and it is
          written <m>\mu(t)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Let me do some algebra again with this new definition. First,
      I'll take the full expression for <m>y_p</m> I ended with above
      and move the first exponential to the right side. Then I can
      differentiate both sides and replace the integrating factor with
      the notation I just introduced.

      </md>
      Let me emphasize what has happened here: multiplying by the
      integrating factor turns the expression <m>y_p^\prime(t) + P(t)
      y_p(t)</m> into something that looks like the result of a a
      product rule derivative. Since it is the result of a derivative,
      it can be easily integrated. This explain the name: the
      integrating factor is something we multiply by to
      allow the DE to be directly integrated. It is best to remember
      the process this way: the original DE becomes a product rule
      derivative problem by multiplying both sides of the original DE
      by the integrating factor and then isolating <m>y_p</m>. In
      practice, this is often the most efficient way to actually go
      about solving a linear DE; it is the method I will use in the
      examples and my solutions to the activities.

          Since there is a <m>t</m> in the denominator, I must avoid
          <m>t=0</m> in the domain of solutions. That doesn't
          necessarily affect the process, but it is good to remember
          when I look at the final solutions. I first look for the

          derivative. After expressing it as such a derivative, I

          Notice that I actually get the the homogeneous pieces here
          from the constant of integration, getting the whole linear
          family. The family already has the expected form: a
          particular solution added to some multiple (using the
          parameter <m>c</m>) of the homogeneous solution. Also notice
          that <m>t=0</m> is excluded from the domain of the solution,
          as I expected from the form of the original equation.

          This is just a homogeneous DE. I can notice that <m>t \neq
          \pm 3</m> in the domain, since the term <m>t^2 - 9</m> will
          be in the denominator when I write this in the standard form.
          The solution to the homogeneous case is calcualted directly

            </mrow>
          </md>.
          Again, I treat the constant of integration informally,
          writing just <m>c</m> instead of the <m>e^c</m> that a more
          formal treatment would give. Also, in the last step, droping
          the absolute value is acceptable since the term inside the
          square root must be positive. I should be a bit careful,
          though, since in the form I have written, I am actually
          missing solutions. The issues with absolute values in
          logarithms arising from integrals can often be problematic
          like this. To find the remaining solution, I write <m>|t^2 -
          9|</m> instead as <m>|9-t^2|</m>. Then the solution would
          have a differen form. 
          <me>
            y = \frac{c}{\sqrt{|9 - t^2|}} = \frac{c}{\sqrt{9 - t^2}}
          </me>.
          The two solutions are both valid, for any positive value of
          <m>c</m>. How can both solutions exist? They exist because
          they have non-overlaping domains. The first solution is
          defined on <m>(-3,3)</m>. The second is defined on
          <m>(-\infty, -3) \cup (3, \infty)</m>. Both domains avoid
          <m>\pm 3</m>, which was expected from the original equation.

          </me>
          To add some complication to this particular example,
          the non-homogeneous piece <m>Q(t)</m> here is a
          step function.
          <me>
            Q(t) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} 1 \amp 0 \leq t \leq 1 \\ 0
            \amp t > 1 \end{matrix} \right.
          </me>
          This is still allowed: often the coefficients and functions
          involved in DEs are only piecewise continuous and/or
          piecewise differentiable. I can still work with them. This
          step function is discontinuous, but still integrable. One of
          the reasons piecewise-continuous function are allowed is
          because they are always integrable. The integrating factor
          is <m>\mu(t) = e^{\int 1 dt} = e^t</m>. Since <m>Q(t)</m>
          is discontinuous, I have to work with two different
          intervals to cover the two different behaviours.  First,
          I'll look at look at <m>[0,1]</m> and apply the standard
          method of solution: multiplying by the integrating factor
          and integrating. 
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dt} e^t y = e^t \implies e^ty = e^t + c_1
            \implies y = 1 + c_1e^{-t}
          </me>
          Second, I'll look at the remainder of the domain, which is
          the interval <m>(1,\infty)</m>. I apply the same method.
          <me>
            \frac{d}{dt} e^t y = 0 \implies e^ty = t + c_2 \implies y

          This process gives two pieces of the solution, each with
          their own constant of integration. However, I want the
          solution to be continuous. (This is also typical: even with
          a discontinuous term in the original equation, I expect the
          result of solving the DE to give me something continuous.) 
          The solution will fail to be differentiable at <m>t=1</m>,
          but that's alright. There is a sudden change in the
          situation at that point, so a sharp corner is expected. 
          Continuity at <m>1</m> means that the limit from the left
          and the limit from the right approaching <m>1</m> must be
          equation. If I calculate both of those limits, I get the
          equation <m>e-c_1 = c_2</m>. This lets me replace
          <m>c_2</m> with <m> e - c_1</m> in the second piece of the
          function. The result is only one constant, which is the
          expected behaviour for a first order differential equation.
          Here is the final solution, a piecewise function with only
          one parameter <m>c</m>.

            y = \left\{ \begin{matrix} 1 - ce^{-t} \amp t \in [0,1]
            \\ (e-c)e^{-t} \amp t \in (1,\infty) \end{matrix}
            \right.

          Since there is only one parameter, initial value problems
          are solvable. If I am given the initial value<m>y(0)
          =0</m>, I find that <m>c=1</m> and I can produce a unique
          solution.
