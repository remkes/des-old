    <p>
      This document containt content and activities for a first course
      in differential equations. It is organized into seven sections. 
    </p>
    <p><ol>
      <li>
        <xref ref="chapter-prelim" /> is an introductory section to
        remind you of some definition and standardize some notation.
        This section is not covered by the activities and will not be
        part of the work during class. It's just there fore your
        reference and review.
      </li>
      <li>
        <xref ref="chapter-first-order-odes" /> is the study of first
        order ordinary differential equations. These are the most
        accessiable kind of DE, making them a natural starting place.
        Even though they are the starting point, they include
        important equations for application, such as the population
        equation (which also describes radioactive decay, heat
        dissipation, and a number of other common natural processes.)
        This section sets the ground work for the rest of the course
        and includes many of the core definitions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <xref ref="chapter-second-order-odes" /> is the study of
        second order ordinary differential equations. Going to second
        order equations means that I can address acceleration (which
        is a second derivative). The motivating example is harmonic
        oscillation: from simple springs and pendulums to more
        complicated applictions inlcuding friction and damping. Second
        order ODEs are important and central enough that the the next
        two chapers are mostly specific techniques for sovling this
        type of equations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <xref ref="chapter-series-solutions" /> is the first of two
        specialized techniques for solving second order ODEs. It uses
        the taylor series to express a function as an infinite series.
        In this form, there are special techniques to understand and
        calculation which infinite series is the solution to the
        equation. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <xref ref="chapter-laplace-transforms" /> is the second of two
        specialized techniques for solving second order ODEs. This is
        a much strange technique than series solutions. I introduce
        the Laplace transform, which is a way of changing functions
        into other functions. This transform allows differential
        equations to be re-interpreted as algebraic equations. This is
        obviously very powerful, since solving algebraic equations is
        much more approachable. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <xref ref="chapter-systems" /> introduces solving a system of
        more than one differential equations. This chapter mostly
        relies on a qualitative analysis of systems of two equations,
        but already that leads into useful and interesting
        applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        <xref ref="chapter-pdes" /> is a brief introduction to partial
        differential equations. I'll really just focus on two
        equations, but they are two very important equations: the heat
        equation and the wave equations. The point of this chapter is
        to give a flavour and idea for the wide world of solving
        partial differential equations.
