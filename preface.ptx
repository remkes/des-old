    <title>Organization</title>
    <p>
      This document containt content and activities for a first course
      in differential equations. It is organized into seven sections. 
    </p>
    <p><ol>
      <li>
        <xref ref="chapter-prelim" /> is an introductory section to
        remind you of some definition and standardize some notation.
        This section is not covered by the activities and will not be
        part of the work during class. It's just there fore your
        reference and review.
      </li>
      <li>
        <xref ref="chapter-first-order-odes" /> is the study of first
        order ordinary differential equations. These are the most
        accessiable kind of DE, making them a natural starting place.
        Even though they are the starting point, they include
        important equations for application, such as the population
        equation (which also describes radioactive decay, heat
        dissipation, and a number of other common natural processes.)
        This section sets the ground work for the rest of the course
        and includes many of the core definitions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <xref ref="chapter-second-order-odes" /> is the study of
        second order ordinary differential equations. Going to second
        order equations means that we can address acceleration (which
        is a second derivative). The motivating example is harmonic
        oscillation: from simple springs and pendulums to more
        complicated applictions inlcuding friction and damping. Second
        order ODEs are important and central enough that the the next
        two chapers are mostly specific techniques for sovling this
        type of equations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <xref ref="section-series-solutions" /> is the first of two
        specialized techniques for solving second order ODEs. It uses
        the taylor series to express a function as an infinite series.
        In this form, there are special techniques to understand and
        calculation which infinite series is the solution to the
        equation. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <xref ref="chaper-laplace-transforms" /> is the second of two
        specialized techniques for solving second order ODEs. This is
        a much strange technique than series solutions. I introduce
        the Laplace transform, which is a way of changing functions
        into other functions. This transform allows differential
        equations to be re-interpreted as algebraic equations. This is
        obviously very powerful, since solving algebraic equations is
        much more approachable.

      This document is not meant to stand alone; instead, it is
      designed to be the written reference material for a set of videos
      or lectures. The main purpose of the document is to be a
      record of the course content which is easier to use for reference
      than the videos. There are some examples in the main body, but
      most examples are presented as activities for the student to
      first attempt and then compare with the posted solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each week of the course, you are expected to watch the videos
      for the week and do the activities and assignmnets presented in
      this notes. In the activities, material labeled ``Extra
      Practice'' or ``Challenge Problems' is optional material.

    <title>Other Resources</title>
    <p>
      In addition to the notes associated to each lecture, there are a
      number of other resources which are distributed via the course
      Moodle site. These resources have been developed to assist you,
      so please make use of them.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A set of pre-calculus notes and learning modules (current
          unfinished).  If you struggled with the self-assessment or
          are otherwise worried about your background mathematical
          knowledge and skills, these resources are here to help you
          learn or practice skills which are prerequisite to this
          course.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A complete formula sheet. All of the basic formulas and
          rules for calculation are included on this sheet. There are
          sections on algebra, trigonometry, derivatives and
          integrals.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A library of functions. This reference gives archetypical
          examples of all of the elementary functions that we use in
          calculus. There are also small example graphs, so that you
          can develop a visual intuition for common functions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A notation reference. Though many of the idea in the course
          have been covered in high-school mathematics, often our
          notations differ. This reference covers a number of
          notations used in the course which may be unfamiliar.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A course outcomes sheet. This was originally developed as a
          study aid for students. It summarizes the main definitions
          and concepts of the course, as well as the types of
          questions your will encounter on assignments and exams.  In
          particular, it gives a guide to the material on the exam.
          If you want to know whether a definition, topic or type of
          problem might show up on the exam, consult this sheet.
          There will be nothing on the exam that isn't referenced on
          this sheet.

    <title>Perspectives and Philosophy</title>
    <p>
      In addition to the strictly mathematical material of the course, I
      will try to share some ideas about the philosophy of mathematics,
      the aesthetics of mathematics, and how our own worldview and
      assumptions influence mathematical thought.
