  <title>Fourier Series</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The answer to the question at the end of the <xref
      ref="section-heat-equation" />  is very positive: most functions
      can, in fact, be approximated by a series with term <m>\sin
      nx</m>. These series are called Fourier series and I'll spend
      the current section defining and investigating them.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection xml:id="subsection-bases">
    <title>Series and Bases for Functions</title>
    <p>
      The series in <xref ref="section-heat-equation" /> only involved
      sine functions, but the general Fourier series involves both
      sine and cosine.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>a_n</m> and <m>b_n</m> be real numbers. A
          <term>Fourier series</term> is a series of the form
          <me>
            f(x) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \cos (nx) +
            \sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n \sin (nx)
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      In general, function as series can be consider a sums over a
      particular basis. For Taylor series, the basis was the set of
      monomials: <m>x^n</m> for <m>n \in \NN</m>. A Taylor series is
      an attempt to write a general function as a sum of these
      monomials. For Fourier series, the is <m>\{ 1, \cos nx, \sin nx
      \}</m> for <m>n \in \NN</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a Fourier series, I can split the basis into two pieces: the
      sine pieces and the cosine pieces (including the constant
      <m>1</m> in the later). If I restrict to only one piece, I
      could form a Fourier sine series or Fourier cosine series. The
      sine pieces are all odd functions; therefore, a Fourier sine
      series must be an odd function. Likewise, the cosine pieces
      (including the constant) are all even functions, so a Fourier
      cosines series must be an even function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given a general function <m>f</m>, I can write <m>f = f_+
      + f_-</m> where <m>f_+</m> is even and <m>f_-</m> is odd. The
      pieces are easy to define: <m>f_+ = \frac{1}{2} (f(x) +
      f(-x))</m> and <m>f_- = \frac{1}{2} (f(x) - f(-x))</m>. If
      <m>f</m> has a Fourier series, then <m>f_-</m>, the odd piece,
      will have a Fourier sine series and <m>f_+</m>, the even piece,
      will have a Fourier cosine series. The heat equation, since I
      insisted on starting at <m>(0,0)</m> and only considering
      positive values, only needs one of the two types. Since sines
      arose in the solution, I'll assume the solution to the heat
      equation is odd and rely on Fourier sine series.

    <title>Scope of Fourier Series</title>
    <p>
      The good news about Fourier series is that they cover a large
      family of functions.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f</m> is periodic and piecewise continuous on
          <m>\RR</m> with period <m>2T</m>, the there exists
          <m>a_n</m> and <m>b_n</m> such that
          <me>
            f(x) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \cos \left(
            \frac{n\pi x}{T} \right) + \sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n \sin
            \left( \frac{n\pi x}{T} \right)
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      If I don't want to work with periodic functions, I can simply
      look at any piecewise-continuous function defined on
      <m>[0,2T)</m>, thinking of it as one period, and find a Fourier
      series for it. (This method works for any finite intervals.)
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f</m> is piecewise continuous on <m>[0,2T)</m> then
          there exists <m>a_n</m> and <m>b_n</m> such that 
          <me>
            f(x) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \cos \left(
            \frac{n\pi x}{T} \right) + \sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n \sin
            \left( \frac{n\pi x}{T} \right)
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      Therefore, I can use Fourier series to approximate any
      piecewise continuous function on a bounded interval. This is a
      very large class of functions.

    <title>Properties of Fourier Series</title>
    <p>
      When I talked about the Legendre polynomials, I derived a very
      nice orthogonality property for them. As opposed to the
      ordinary monomials <m>x^n</m>, the Legengre polynomials were
      pair-wise orthogonal, using integration on <m>[-1,1]</m> as the
      inner product. When I find a basis for a type of series, it is
      very convenient for integration if the basis functions are
      orthogonal. (Like in linear algebra, an orthogonal basis is
      always easy to use).
    </p>
    <p>
      Fourier series terms have wonderful orthogonality properties.
      For convenience, these properties are stated for the period <m>T
      = 2\pi</m>.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>n, m \in \NN</m>, with the possibility that
          <m>m=0</m> to account for the constant term.

            <mrow>
              \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \cos (mx) \cos (nx) dx \amp = \pi

        <p>
          Therefore, all the Fourier basis functions are orthogonal
          under the scalar product given by integration on
          <m>[-\pi,\pi]</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        For the proof, I use the trig identities for products of
        <m>\sin</m> and <m>\cos</m>, such as
        <me>
          \cos A \cos B = \frac{1}{2} \left( \cos(A-B) + \cos (A+B)
          \right)
        </me>.
        I only show the proof of the first of the three statements.
        The proof is to show a particular integral is zero, so I just
        calculate that integral. I use a trig identity to make the
        product into a sum, so that the integral has a reasonable to
        find antiderivaitive.

    </proof>
    <p>
      For Taylor series, there were convenient properties for the
      calculus of the series and the calculation of coefficients.
      Similar properties exist for Fourier series. If I know a
      series is convergent, I can integrate and differentiate
      term-wise. (Not that differentiation and integration change a
      Fourier sine series into a Fourier cosine series and vice-versa.)
    </p>
    <p>
      A method for the the calculation of coefficients comes from the
      orthogonality property. Assume that <m>f(x)</m> is expressed as
      a Fourier series.
      <me>
        f(x) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \cos (nx) +
        \sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n \sin (nx)
      </me>
      Then I can calculate the following integral.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \int_{-\pi}^\pi f(x) \cos mx dx \amp = \int_{-\pi}^\pi
          \frac{a_0}{2} dx + \int_{-\pi}^\pi \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n

          \amp = a_n \pi

      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The integral calculates the coefficient <m>a_n</m>. Similarly,
      the constant coefficient <m>a_0</m> and the sine coefficients
      are calculated by integrals. This gives a general result for
      calculating Fourier coefficients, for <m>n \in \NN</m>.

      If I go back to the heat equation, the initial conditions where

      The coefficients <m>T_n</m> in the full solution to the heat
      equation must be the Fourier coefficients of the initial
      function <m>f(x)</m>. Now I know how to calculate these
