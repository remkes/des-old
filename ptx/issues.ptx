    After these initial examples,
    two of questions seem natural.
    First, we might observe that <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> were,
    so far, only rational functions,
    which means that we only need to deal with polynomials in the calculation.
    What if <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> were other analytic functions?
    In this cases,
    we would have to expand <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> as series about the ordinary point and then multiply them by the series for <m>y</m> in the calculation.
    This is possible, but miserable.
  </p>
  <p>
    We might also wonder why we restricted to homogeneous cases.
    What happens if we add a forcing term <m>f(t)</m>?
    We can certainly do this if <m>f</m> is analytic on the same domain as <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>.
    In all our examples so far, we compared the coefficients to <m>0</m>.
    If we have a forcing terms,
    we would instead compare the coefficients to the coefficient of <m>f</m> instead of <m>0</m>.
    This leads to more complications,
    since the relationship between the coefficients may no longer be a linear recurrence relation.
  </p>
  <p>
    In both of these situations (non-polynomial <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> or non-homogeneous DE with forcing),
    we can easily end up in a situation were the challenges of computation prevent us from finding a nice form for the coefficients of <m>y</m>.
    Quite frequently,
    we will only decide to calculate the first few terms.
    The result is a Taylor polynomial approximation to the solution,
    instead of a complete Taylor series solution.
    However, approximate solutions
    (if they have sufficient precision)
    are often sufficient.
