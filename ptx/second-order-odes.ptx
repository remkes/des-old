  <title>Second Order Linear Differential Equations</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      A second order (ordinary) differential equation involves the second derivative of a function of one variable.
      In full generality,
      this could be any ridiculously complicated expression involving the independent variable,
      the function, its first derivative,
      and its second derivative.

    <example>
      <statement>
        <me>
          \left( \frac{d^2 f}{dt^2} \right)^2 + \frac{\frac{df}{dt} - t^2
          f^2}{\frac{df}{dt} - \frac{d^2 f}{dt^2}} = \frac{t^2 - \sin
          t}{f}
        </me>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      We have basiclaly no idea and no hope for approaching such complicated general cases.
      In this chapter, even more than with first order equations,
      we will restrict to very particular cases where there are useful techniques of solutions.
      The general restriction will be to linear equations,
      but even inside that restriction,
      we will make further assumptions about the structure.

    <p>
      As with first order equations,
      we solve initial value problems.
      However, since we have a second derivative involved, we expect
      (at least implicitly)
      to have to integrate twice.
      This results in two constants of integration.
      Therefore, we will require two initial values.
      Typically, for an equation about a function <m>f(t)</m>,
      there will be an initial value for the function
      <m>f(t_0) = a</m> and an initial value for the derivative <m>f^\prime(t_1) = b</m>.
      In most cases,
      a specific solution can only be found if both initial values are specified.
