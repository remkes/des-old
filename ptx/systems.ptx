  <title>Systems of Differential Equations</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      So far, our differential equations involves one dependent variable and one independent variable
      (typically time).
      It's very common to have two or more variables which all depend on the same independent variable and whose derivatives interact with each other.
      This interaction produces systems of differential equations involving those functions and their derivatives.
      This chapter introduces qualitative analysis of systems of DEs and solutions to linear systems using Laplace transforms.
