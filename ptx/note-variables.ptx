  <title>A Note on Variables</title>
  <p>
    In differential equation,
    the name of the independent variable is almost always either <m>x</m> or <m>t</m>.
    <m>x</m> is conventional, of course, in calculus;
    it is also useful for certain geometric interpretation where we want <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> to correspond to the familiar cartesian axes.
    We will use <m>x</m> as the independnet variable at certain points in the courses,
    particularly when we use these geometric techniques.

  <p>
    The vast majority of differential equations that we want to solve involve time derivatives;
    therefore, <m>t</m> is often the most natural choice for the independent variable.
    We will use <m>t</m> instead of <m>x</m> for the majority of this course.
    Often in the literature,
    a derivative in Newton's notation (<m>f^\prime</m>) implies that the independent variable is time.
