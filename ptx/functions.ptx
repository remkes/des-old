              <m>C(A)</m> is the set of continuous real-valued function on <m>A</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>\RR</m>.
        A function <m>f:A \rightarrow \RR</m> is
        <term>piecewise-continuous</term>
        on <m>A</m> if it continous everywhere on <m>A</m> except for a set of isolated point.
        Likewise, <m>f</m> is <term>piecewise-differentiable</term>
        on <m>A</m> if it differentiable everywhere on <m>A</m> except for a set of isolated points.
        Note that <m>A</m> is the domain of the function:
        these piecewise functions can have jumps or break,
        but they are defined on all of <m>A</m>.
        They cannot have, for example,
        asymptotes at these isolated points.

  <p>
    We almost exclusively use the base <m>e</m> in this course,
    since it is the easiest base for derivatives and integrals.
    Since any other base <m>a^t</m> can be written <m>a^t = e^{\ln a t}</m>,
    we will very frequently work with functions of the form
    <m>e^{\alpha t}</m> for some <m>\alpha \in \RR</m>.
    In this way, we cover all exponential bases.
