  <title>Laplace Transforms and Derivatives</title>
  <p>
    This is a course on differential equations;
    if Laplace transforms are useful,
    we will need them to relate to derivatives.
    Let's calculate what happens to a derivative of a function
    (of exponential order)
    in a Laplace transform.
    <md>
      <mrow>\calL \left\{ \frac{df}{dt} \right\} \amp  = \int_0^\infty \frac{df}{dt} e^{-st} dt</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp  = \left. fe^{-st} \right|_0^\infty - \int_0^\infty (-s) f(t) e^{-st} dt</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp  = \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty} f(a) e^{-sa} - f(0) + s \calL \{ f(t) \} (s) = -f(0) + s F(s)</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    We can sumarize the result in a rule.
    <me>
      \calL \{ f^\prime(t) \} (s) = -f(0) + sF(s)
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a lovely and convenient property.
    In the <m>s</m>-domain, there is no more differentiation.
    We just have multiplication by the <m>s</m> term and evaluation of the function at a point.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can do a similar calculation for second derivatives.
    The calculation will involve two uses of integration by parts,
    though we can make use of the previous calcullation to simplify the work.
    <md>
      <mrow>\calL \left\{ \frac{d^2f}{dt^2} \right\} \amp  = \int_0^\infty \frac{d^2f}{dt^2} e^{-st} dt</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp  = \left. \frac{df}{dt} e^{-st} \right|_0^\infty + s\int_0^\infty \frac{df}{dt} e^{-st} dt</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp  = -f^\prime(0) - sf(0) + s^2 F(s)</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, this is very convenient.
    The derivatives are completely removed in the <m>s</m>-domain,
    replaced with simple algebraic operations.
    The general result for any order of differentiation is
    <me>
      \calL \left\{ \frac{d^n f}{dt^n} \right\} = s^n F(s) - s^{n-1} f(0) - s^{n-2} f^\prime(0) - s^{n-3} f^{\prime \prime}(0) - \ldots - f^{(n-1)}(0)
    </me>.
  </p>

    This leads to the amazing use of Laplace transforms in solving DEs.
    A Laplace transform change differentiation into simple algebraic operations;
    therefore, it should change some DEs into algebraic equations.
    Since algebraic equations are much easier to solve than DEs, this is a huge advantage.
    However, we have one problem.
    If we want to solve a DE, we want to solve it in the <m>t</m>-domain.
    We can transform to the <m>s</m>-domain and solve the algebraic equation,
    but we need to get back to the <m>t</m>-domain to finish.
    For this, we need to invert the transform,
    which we will defined in the next section.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before we move on,
    here are two other properties of the Laplace transform which relate to derivatives.
    The first shows that integrals are also changed into something algebraic.
    <me>
      \calL \left\{ \int_0^t f(u) du \right\} = \frac{1}{s} \calL \{ f(t) \}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    The second is a parallel identity which shows how differentiation in the <m>s</m>-domain also comes from an algebraic operation on the <m>t</m>-domain.
    <me>
      \calL \{ t^n f(t) \} = (-1)^n \frac{d^n}{ds^n} \calL \{ f(t) \}
    </me>
  </p>
