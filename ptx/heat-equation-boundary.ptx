    The general solution in this case is the sum of this steady There are many pieces to the setup and solution of a PDE. In what we've done so far for the heat equation,
    we allowed a nearly-arbitrary initial conditions,
    since any function which has a Fourier series satisfied.
    However, our boundary conditions were very restrictive.
    We can get more complicated situations if we relax the boundary conditions.
    A small increase in complexity comes from constant but non-equal boundary conditions:
    <m>u(0,t) = A</m> and <m>u(\pi,t) = B</m> for some constants <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
    This is a situation where we will keep the ends of the rod at constant temperature,
    but those temperatures need not be the same.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this case, seperation of variables when
    <m>\alpha = 0</m> implies that <m>X(x)</m> must be a linear function.
    Matching the boundary contions
    (with a rod of length <m>\pi</m>)
    means that <m>X(x) = \frac{B-A}{\pi}x + A</m>.
    This is called the steady-state solution and it is the base case of the situation. (For the previous case with zero boundary conditions,
    the steady state solution was just
    <m>X(x) = 0</m>.) The steady-state solution is the solution to which we want the situaiton to diffuse;
    it is the resting case.
    With non-equal boundary conditions,
    the steady state involves a heat flow along the rod,
    from the warmer end to the cooler.
    A complicated initial heat-situation will diffuse and reduce to a straight-line distribution between the tempeartures at each end as show in <xref ref="figure-diffusion1">Figure</xref>.

    state with our previous solutions.
    The linearity of the system means that the solution with both boundary conditions set to <m>0</m> can simply be added to this steady state to give the general solution.
    <me>
      u(x,t) = \frac{2}{\pi} \sum_{n=1}^\infty T_n e^{-kn^2t} \sin (nx)
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    The calculation of the Fourier coefficients <m>T_n</m>,
    however, needs an adjustment.
    We need to shift the function back to a 0-equilibrium situation to repeat the result of the previous section.
    With that shift, the integral that calculates the coefficient is
    <me>
      T_n = \frac{2}{\pi} \int_0^\pi \left( f(x) - \frac{B-A}{\pi} x - A \right) \sin nx dx
    </me>.

        We use an example to see what this looks like with explicit numbers.
        This example is from Roberts and Marion.
        Set the boundary contidions to be <m>u(0,t) = 1</m> and
        <m>u(\pi,
        t) = 1 + \pi</m> and the initial condition <m>u(x,0) = x^2 + (1-\pi)x + 1</m>.
        The steady state solution is the line <m>u = x+1</m>.
        We calculate the Fourier coefficients.
