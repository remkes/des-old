  <title>Fourier Series</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The answer to the question at the end of the previous section is very positive:
      most functions can, in fact,
      be approximated by a series with term <m>\sin nx</m>.
      These series are called Fourier series and we'll spend the current section defining and investigating them.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection xml:id="bases">
    <title>Series and Bases for Functions</title>
    <p>
      The series in the previous section only involved sine functions,
      but the general Fourier series involves both sine and cosine.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>a_n</m> and <m>b_n</m> be real numbers.
          A <term>Fourier series</term> is a series of the form
          <me>
            f(x) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \cos (nx) + \sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n \sin (nx)
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      In general, function as series can be consider a sums over a particular basis.
      For Taylor series, the basis was the set of monomials:
      <m>x^n</m> for <m>n \in \NN</m>.
      A Taylor series is an attempt to write a general function as a sum of these monomials.
      For Fourier series, the is
      <m>\{ 1, \cos nx, \sin nx \}</m> for <m>n \in \NN</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a Fourier series, we can split the basis into two pieces:
      the sine pieces and the cosine pieces
      (including the constant <m>1</m> in the later).
      If we restrict to only one piece,
      we could form a Fourier sine series or Fourier cosine series.
      The sine pieces are all odd functions;
      therefore, a Fourier sine series must be an odd function.
      Likewise, the cosine pieces
      (including the constant)
      are all even functions,
      so a Fourier cosines series must be an even function.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we have a general function <m>f</m>,
      we can write <m>f = f_+ + f_-</m> where <m>f_+</m> is even and <m>f_-</m> is odd.
      The pieces are easy to define:
      <m>f_+ = \frac{1}{2} (f(x) + f(-x))</m> and <m>f_- = \frac{1}{2} (f(x) - f(-x))</m>.
      If <m>f</m> has a Fourier series,
      then <m>f_-</m>, the odd piece,
      will have a Fourier sine series and <m>f_+</m>, the even piece,
      will have a Fourier cosine series.
      The heat equation,
      since we insisted on starting at <m>(0,0)</m> and only considering positive values,
      only needs one of the two types.
      Since sines arose in the solution,
      we'll assume the solution to the heat equation is odd and rely on Fourier sine series.

    <title>Scope of Fourier Series</title>
    <p>
      The good news about Fourier series is that they cover a large family of functions.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f</m> is periodic and piecewise continuous on <m>\RR</m> with period <m>2T</m>,
          the there exists <m>a_n</m> and <m>b_n</m> such that
          <me>
            f(x) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \cos \left( \frac{n\pi x}{T} \right) + \sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n \sin \left( \frac{n\pi x}{T} \right)
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      If we don't want to work with periodic functions,
      we can simply look at any piecewise-continuous function defined on <m>[0,2T)</m>,
      thinking of it as one period,
      and find a Fourier series for it.
      (This method works for any finite intervals.)
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f</m> is piecewise continuous on <m>[0,2T)</m> then there exists <m>a_n</m> and <m>b_n</m> such that
          <me>
            f(x) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \cos \left( \frac{n\pi x}{T} \right) + \sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n \sin \left( \frac{n\pi x}{T} \right)
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      Therefore, we can use Fourier series to approximate any piecewise continuous function on a bounded interval,
      which is a very large class of functions.

    <title>Properties of Fourier Series</title>
    <p>
      When we talked about the Lagrange polynomials,
      we derived a very nice orthogonality property for them.
      As opposed to the ordinary monomials <m>x^n</m>,
      the Lagrange polynomials were pair-wise orthogonal,
      using integration on <m>[-1,1]</m> as the inner product.
      When we find a basis for a type ofseries,
      it is very convenient for integration if the basis functions are orthogonal. (Like in linear algebra,
      an orthogonal basis is always easy to use).
    </p>
    <p>
      Fourier series terms have wonderful orthogonality properties.
      For convenience,
      these properties are stated for the period <m>T = 2\pi</m>.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>n, m \in \NN</m>,
          with the possibility that <m>m=0</m> to account for the constant term.
          <md>
            <mrow>\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \cos (mx) \cos (nx) dx \amp  = \pi \delta_{mn}</mrow>
            <mrow>\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \sin (mx) \sin (nx) dx \amp  = \pi \delta_{mn}</mrow>
            <mrow>\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \cos (mx) \sin (nx) dx \amp  = 0</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, all the Fourier basis functions are orthogonal under the scalar product given by integration on <m>[-\pi,\pi]</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        For the proof,
        we use the trig identities for products of <m>\sin</m> and <m>\cos</m>, such as
        <me>
          \cos A \cos A = \frac{1}{2} \left( \cos(A-B) + \cos (A+B) \right)
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We only show the proof of the first of the three statements.
        <md>
          <mrow>\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \cos (mx) \cos (nx) dx \amp  = \frac{1}{2} \int_{-\pi}^\pi \cos ((m-n)x) + \cos((m+x)x)dx</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \frac{1}{2} \left. \left[ \frac{-\sin((m-n)x)}{m-n} - \frac{-\sin((m+n)x)}{m+n} \right] \right|_{-\pi}^{\pi} = 0 \hspace{2cm} \text{ if }  m \neq n</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \frac{1}{2} \int_{-\pi}^\pi 1 + \cos 2m dx</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \frac{1}{4} \left. \left( \frac{-\sin mx}{m} \right) + \frac{x}{2} \right|_{\pi}^\pi = 0 + \frac{2\pi}{2} = \pi \hspace{2cm} \text{ if }  m = n</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      For Taylor series,
      we had convenient properties for the calculus of the series and the calculation of coefficients.
      Similar properties exist for Fourier series.
      If we know a series is convergent,
      we can integrate and differentiate term-wise.
      (Not that differentiation and integration change a Fourier sine series into a Fourier cosine series and vice-versa.)
    </p>
    <p>
      A method for the the calculation of coefficients comes from the orthogonality property.
      Assume that <m>f(x)</m> is expressed as a Fourier series.
      <me>
        f(x) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \cos (nx) + \sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n \sin (nx)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we can calculate an integral.
      <md>
        <mrow>\int_{-\pi}^\pi f(x) \cos mx dx \amp  = \int_{-\pi}^\pi \frac{a_0}{2} dx + \int_{-\pi}^\pi \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \cos (nx) dx + \int_{-\pi}^\pi \sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n \sin (nx) dx</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = 0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \pi \delta_{mn} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty 0</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = a_n \pi</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The integral calculates the coefficient <m>a_n</m>.
      Similarly, the constant coefficient <m>a_0</m> and the sine coefficients are calculated by integrals.
      This gives a general result for calculating Fourier coefficients,
      for <m>n \in \NN</m>.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f</m> is expressed as a Fourier series,
          then the Fourier coefficient <m>a_n</m> and <m>b_n</m> satisfy these equations.

    <title>Finishing the Heat Equation Solution</title>
    <p>
      If we go back to the heat equation,
      the initial conditions where
      <m>u(x,0) = f(x)</m> for some given function <m>f</m> on
      <m>[0, \pi]</m> with <m>f(0) = f(\pi) = 0</m>.
      When <m>t=0</m>, we wrote that

        f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty T_n \sin (nx)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coefficients <m>T_n</m> in the full solution to the heat equation must be the Fourier coefficients of the initial function <m>f(x)</m>.
      Now we know how to calculate these coefficients.
      Since this is a sine series, we expect that <m>f</m> is odd,
      and we extend it to <m>(-\pi,\pi)</m> as an odd function.
      Then we integrate to find the coefficients.

      Therefore, the full solution to the heat equation,

      <me>
        u(x,t) = \frac{2}{\pi} \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left[ \int_0^\pi f(x) \sin nx) dx \right] e^{-kn^2t} \sin (nx)
