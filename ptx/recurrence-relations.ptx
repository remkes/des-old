    A sequence <m>\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty</m> of real numbers is called a
    <em>linear recurrence relation</em>
    if each term <m>a_n</m> is a linear function of the previous <m>k</m> terms <m>a_{n-1}, \ldots a_{n-k}</m>.
    <m>k</m> is called the <em>order</em>
    of the recurrence relation.
    Since terms depends on previous terms,
    the first <m>k</m> terms of the sequence must be explicitly defined.
  </p>
  <p>
    The most famous example is the Fibonacci sequence,
    which is a second order linear recurrence relation.
    Its terms, <m>f_n</m>, start with
    <m>f_1 = f_2 = 1</m> and then obey the linear recurrence <m>f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}</m>.
  </p>

    If we are given a recurrence relation relation,
    we don't have a direct way to calculate the term <m>a_n</m> without calculating all the previous terms.
    <em>Solving</em> a recurrence relation is the term for finding a fixed formula
    <m>a_n = f(n)</m> that describes the <m>n</m>th term of the sequence.
    These can be easy or difficult to find.
    The fixed formula for Fibonnaci is
    <me>
      f_n = \frac{(1+\sqrt{5})^n - (1-\sqrt{5})^n}{2^n \sqrt{5}}
    </me>.

    The coefficients of a Taylor series are sequences of real numbers.
    In our use of Taylor series,
    sequences of coefficients will be presented as recurrence relations.
    We will want to solve the recurrence relations to give a closed formula for the coefficients,
    in order to understand the resulting Taylor series.
