    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The Laplace transform
          (like all reasonable operations in analysis)
          is linear.
          <md>
            <mrow>\calL \{ f+ g \} \amp  = \calL \{ f \} + \calL \{ g \}</mrow>
            <mrow>\calL \{ c f(t)\} \amp  = c \calL \{ f \}</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      As we will discover, the Laplace transform is not multiplicative.
      The question of how we deal with products (<m>\calL \{ fg \}</m>) will come later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, the asymptotic order of <m>f</m> was important to allowing the definition of the Laplace transform.
      However, all the transforms we've seen so far are decaying functions.
      This is a general statment:
      for any function <m>f(t)</m> of exponential order <m>c > 0</m>, we have
      <me>
        \lim_{s \rightarrow \infty} \calL \{ f(t) \} (s) = 0
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This property is a useful check:
      if you ever get a Laplace transform which doesn't have this limit,
      you've made a mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the same students who like linear algebra,
      this gives us a specific understanding of the Laplace transform.
      Let <m>EOF(0,\infty)</m> be the space of piecewise-continuous functions of exponential order defined on <m>(0, \infty)</m>
      (<m>EOF</m> for exponential order functions).
      Let <m>DF^+</m> be the set of continuous functions which are defined on
      <m>(a, \infty)</m> for some <m>a > 0</m> and have limit <m>0</m> as
      <m>s \rightarrow \infty</m> (DF for decay functions).
      These are both linear spaces, since addition,
      subtraction and multiplication by constants preserve the properties of definition.
      The the Laplace transform is a linear map
      <me>
        \calL : EOF(0,\infty) \rightarrow DF^+
      </me>.

    <title>Shifts</title>
    <p>
      We said we'd return to Laplace transforms of products.
      We still can't handle the general case,
      but there is a nice property for multiplication by an exponential function.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <md>
          <mrow>\calL \{ e^{at} f(t) \} (s) \amp  = \int_0^\infty e^{at} f(t)
          e^{-st} dt</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \int_0^\infty f(t) e^{at-st} dt = \int_0^\infty f(t)
          e^{(a-s)t} dt</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \calL \{ f(t) \} (s-a)</mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
          Multiplication by <m>e^{at}</m> in the <m>t</m> domain results in a shift by <m>a</m> in the <m>s</m> domain.
          This also adjust the domain of <m>s</m>,
          reflected the fact that multiplication by <m>e^{at}</m> adjusts the exponential order.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      Shifts are quite important in the whole theory.
      We can also ask what happens when we shift in the <m>t</m> domain.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>unit step function</term>
          <m>u_a(t)</m> if defined as
          <me>
            u_a(t) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} 0 \amp  t \lt  a \\ 1 \amp  t \geq a. \end{matrix} \right.
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The unit step function <m>u_a(t) f(t)</m> cancels any part of <m>f</m> for <m>t\lt a</m>,
      but preserves <m>f</m> for <m>t \geq a</m>.
      To define a shift of <m>f</m>,
      we can write <m>u_a(t) f(t-a)</m> to remove anything before <m>t=0</m> from <m>f</m>.
      (Note that we're allowed piecewise continuous function for Laplace transforms.)
      We calculate to find the result of this shift in the <m>t</m>-domain.
      <md>
        <mrow>\calL \{ u_a(t) \} (s) \amp  = \int_0^\infty u_a(t) e^{-st} dt = \int_a^\infty e^{-st} dt</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = \left. \frac{-e^{-st}}{s} \right|_a^\infty = \frac{e^{-as}}{s}</mrow>
        <mrow>\calL \{ u_a (t) f(t-a)\} (s) \amp  = \int_a^\infty e^{-st} f(t-a) dt</mrow>
        <mrow>v \amp  = t-a</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = \int_0^\infty e^{-s(v+a)} f(v) dv = e^{-sa} \int_0^\infty e^{-sv} f(v) dv</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = e^{-sa} \calL \{ f(t) \} (s) = e^{-sa} F(s)</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a nice parallel here,
      though it's not a perfect symmetry.
      Shifts in one domain correspond to multiplication by exponentials in the other domain.
