  <title>Partial Differential Equations</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      So far, this has been a course in ordinary differential equations,
      where our functions depended on one variable.
      The theory of differential equations gets much more involved and interesting when we move to functions of several variables.
      The equations also get more difficult to solve;
      solving a single partial differential equation (PDE) can be the work of a whole book,
      a whole thesis or a whole career.
      For some examples,
      the solutions to a particular PDE are a whole branch of mathematics.

      Many examples involve functions which depend on both position and time.
      The root of modern physics is found in differential equations that relate time derivatives to position derivatives.
      There are two particularly celebrated examples.

          The Navier-Stokes equation is the fundamental equation of fluid dynamics.
          There are several forms, but we'll state the form for incompressible flows.
          In this equation,
          <m>u</m> is the field describing the fluid flow as a function on <m>x,y,z,t</m>
          (position and time),
          <m>\nabla</m> is a differential operator,
          <m>P</m> is the pressure of the fluid,
          <m>\rho</m> is the density of the fluid,
          and <m>\nu</m> is the viscosity of the fluid.

            \frac{\del u}{\del t} + u \cdot \nabla u = - \frac{\nabla P}{\rho} + \nu \nabla^2 u

          The Schrodinger equation is the fundamental PDE in quantum mechanics
          (at least in its early versions).
          In the Schrodinger equation,
          <m>\Psi</m> is the wave function which describes the probabilities of measurements in a physical system,
          <m>\imath</m> is the familiar complex number,
          <m>\hbar</m> is a constant, <m>m</m> is mass and <m>V</m> is a potential.
          This is the one-dimensional version,
          so <m>\Psi</m> depends on <m>x</m> and <m>t</m>.
          <me>
            \imath \hbar \frac{\del \Psi}{\del t} = \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\del^2 \Psi}{\del x^2} + V(x) \Psi
