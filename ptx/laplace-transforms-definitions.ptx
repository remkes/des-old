  <p>
    In functional analysis,
    we have a group of operations on functions called transforms.
    These operations act on a certain set of functions and transform then into new functions:
    through the transforms, we see behaviour that was previously hidden.
  </p>
  <p>
    The changes due to transforms are often radical:
    the resulting functions do not look anything like the originals.
    We can think of transforms as radically altering the environment of the function,
    so that everything changes into a surprisingly different form.
  </p>
  <p>
    For those who like to think in linear algebra terms,
    we can think of the space of functions defined on some interval in <m>\RR</m> as a vector space. (The specific vector space depends on the interval and the class of function:
    continuous, piecewise-continuous, differentiable, etc).
    In this language,
    transforms are nothing but interesting linear transformations between vector spaces of functions.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this section, we study the Laplace transform.
    It applies to a functions with certain controls on their asymptotic growth,
    which we now define.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A function <m>f(t)</m> defined on <m>[0, \infty)</m> is of
        <term>exponential order c</term>
        if <m>\exists M > 0 \ \ \exists T > 0</m> such that <m>\forall t > T \ \ \ |f(t)| \lt Me^{ct}</m>.
        Asymptotically, this is equivalent to
        <m>f \in \calO(e^{ct})</m> for some real positive <m>c</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    If <m>f(t)</m> is a piecewise-continuous function on
    <m>[0, \infty)</m> of exponential order <m>c</m>,
    then its Laplace transform is
    <me>
      \calL \{ f(t) \} (s) = \int_0^\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Laplace transform is defined on the domain <m>(c, \infty)</m>.
    We can check that this improper integral converges for all <m>s \in (c, \infty)</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The restriction of exponential order is a fairly reasonable one:
    in differential equations and applied mathematics,
    we are rarely concerned with functions which grow faster than the exponential.
  </p>
  <p>
    The choice of variables is standard for Lapalce transforms.
    We will often refer to the original functions as functions in the <m>t</m>-domain,
    and to their transforms as functions in the <m>s</m>-domain.
    In addition,
    if <m>f(t)</m> and <m>g(t)</m> are function in the <m>t</m>-domain,
    we will also often write <m>F(s)</m> and <m>G(s)</m> for their Laplace transforms.
    By convention,
    we use lower case for the <m>t</m>-domain and uppercase for the matching function in the <m>s</m>-domain.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most of the following examples are sub-exponential,
    so we expect a transform on <m>(0, \infty)</m>.
    Note that we are never guaranteed convergence at <m>0</m>.

        \right|_0^\infty = \frac{-1}{a-s} = \frac{1}{s-a} \hspace{2cm}

        Our first observation about Laplace transforms is simply their strangeness.
        Powers of <m>t</m> turn into inverse powers of <m>s</m>,
        but exponentials
        (which are very different)
        turn into very similar reciprocals.

        We said that Lapalce transforms exist for piecewise-continuous functions with a certain exponential order.
        Here is an example for a piecewise continuous function and its transform.
        <md>
          <mrow>f(t) \amp  = \left\{ \begin{matrix} 0 \amp  t \in [0,1]</mrow>
          <mrow>t \amp  t \in [1, \infty) \end{matrix} \right.</mrow>
          <mrow>\calL \{ f(t) \} \amp  = \int_0^\infty f(t) e^{-st} dt</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \int_1^\infty te{-st} dt = \left. \frac{-te^{-st}}{s} \right|_1^\infty + \int_1^\infty \frac{e^{-st}}{s} dt</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \frac{-e^{-s}}{s} + 0 + \left. \frac{-e^{-st}}{s^2} \right|_1^\infty = \frac{-e^{-s}}{s} - \frac{e^{-s}}{s^2} = \frac{-(s+1)e^{-s}}{s^2}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Laplace transform is not a piecewise function,
        even thought the original was.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The Laplace transform of <m>t^n</m> for <m>n \in \ZZ</m> involved factorials,
        so it is not surprising that
        <m>t^\alpha</m> for non-integer <m>\alpha</m> involves the extension of the factorial:
        the <m>\Gamma</m> function.
        <md>
          <mrow>\calL \{ t^\alpha \} \amp  = \int_0^\infty e^{-st} t^{\alpha} dt</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \int_0^\infty t^{(\alpha + a) - 1} e^{-st}</mrow>
          <mrow>u \amp  = st</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \int_0^\infty \left( \frac{u}{s} \right)^{(\alpha+1)-1} e^{-u} \frac{du}{s}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp  = \frac{1}{s^{\alpha +1}} \int_0^\infty u^{(\alpha+ 1)-1} e^{-u} du = \frac{\Gamma(\alpha +1)}{s^{\alpha +1}}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Finally, Laplace transforms are defined for some important oscillating functions,
        such as the trigonometric functions and the Bessel functions.
        <md>
          <mrow>\calL \{ \sin t \} \amp  = \int_0^\infty e^{-st} \sin t dt = \frac{1}{s^2+1}</mrow>
          <mrow>\calL \{ \cos t \} \amp  = \frac{s}{s^2+1}</mrow>
          <mrow>\calL \{ J_0(kt) \} \amp  = \frac{1}{\sqrt{s^2 + k^2}}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, note the strangeness:
        even starting with transcendental and non-elementary functions like these,
        the Lapalce transforms are rational and algebraic functions.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    As an aside, I mentioned at the start of this chapter that the Laplace transform is not the only transform in mathematics.
    The most well-known and well-used transform is the Fourier transform.
    It uses the same conventions about the <m>s</m> and the <m>t</m> domains,
    but it applies to complex valued functions.
    In place of the <m>e^{-st}</m> term in the Laplace transform,
    the Fourier transform uses the complex <m>e^{-2\pi \imath st}</m>.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>Fourier transform</term>
        of a function <m>f(s)</m> is given by this integral.
        <me>
          \hat{f}(s) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t) e^{-2\pi \imath t s} dt
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
