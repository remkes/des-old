        <p>
          A <term>differential equation</term>
          is any equation involving a function <m>f(t)</m> and its derivatives <m>f^\prime(t)</m>,
          <m>f^{\prime \prime}(t)</m>, etc.
          The highest derivative in the equation is called the
          <term>order</term> of the equation.
          A DE which involves partial derivatives is called a
          <term>partial differential equation</term>;
          otherwise, it is called an <term>ordinary differtial equation</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      More holistically, a differential equation asks the question:
      what function satisfies a given relationship?
      In algebra, we are familiar with this question for numbers.
      <m>t + 5 = 7</m> implicitly asks which number,
      when replacing <m>t</m>, satisfies the equation.
      The answer, of course, is <m>t=2</m>;
      the solution to the equation gives the correct replacement.
      For differential equations,
      we ask <sq>what function</sq> instead of <sq>what number</sq>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many ways to write a differential equation.
      The most general way is to think of any algebraic combination of a function <m>y</m>,
      its derivatives and the independent variable <m>t</m>.
      In this generality,
      we could write the equation using a multivariable function <m>F</m>.
      <me>
        F(t,y, y^\prime, \ldots, y^{(n)}) = 0
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Often, if we can, we isolate the highest derivative.
      <me>
        y^{(n)} = F(t,y,y^\prime, \ldots, y^{(n-1)})
      </me>
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A differential equation is called <term>autonomous</term>
          is the independent variable doesn't appear.
          For a first order equation, this looks like
          <me>
            \frac{dy}{dt} = f(y)
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An equation is called <term>linear</term> if it has the form
          <me>
            a_n(t)y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}(t)y^{(n-1)} + \ldots + a_1(t) y^\prime + a_0(t) y = f(t)
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition,
          a linear equation is called <term>homogenous</term>
          if the <m>f(t)</m> term is simply <m>f(t) = 0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      A very useful notational tool for linear DEs is the idea of a linear differential operator.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="definition-linear-differential-operator">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>differentiable operator</term>
          is an operator which acts on functions by either multplication by fixed functions or by differentiation.
          The operator is <term>linear</term>
          if the various pieces of the operation are added together.
          Fore example, a second order linear equation has this form
          <me>
            L = a(t) \frac{d^2}{dt^2} + b(t) \frac{d}{dt} + c
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use differentiable operators to simplify notation for DE. A second order linear DE become simply <m>Ly = f(t)</m>.

    </figure>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The simplest differential equation is
          <me>
            \frac{df}{dt} = \alpha f(t)
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For many differential equations,
          we seek a translation of their meaning.
          This simple equation means the rate of change is propotional to the current value.
          This is a statement of percentage growth;
          the proportionality constant is the percentage.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      The solutions to this equation are are <m>f(t) = ce^{\alpha t}</m>.
      Notice that there is a constant, <m>c</m>,
      such that there will be a whole infinite family of solutions.
      A specific solution is specified by a choice of <m>c</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percentage growth applies to population models.
      If this is the case,
      then <m>f(0) = ce^0 = c</m> and we must interpret the constant <m>c</m> as the population when <m>t=0</m>.
      If this is our starting point,
      we consider <m>c</m> the <em>initial value</em> of the solution.
      A full solution of a differential equation will usually consist of a function and choice(s) for the initial value(s).
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A differential equation along with a specified initial value is called an
          <term>initial value problem</term> or IVP.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      If we don't make a choice,
      as we said, we get an infinite family of solutions.
      We can visualize this family as a series of graphs in <m>\RR^2</m>.

    <title>Pure and Applied Perspectives</title>
    <p>
      We will be looking at differential equation both from a pure mathematics and applied mathematics point of view.
      The pure mathematician is interested in these kinds of questions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            When does a solution exists?
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            Can we prove that a solution exists?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Is the solution unique?

        <li>
          <p>
            Is there a complete family?

          <p>
            Can we write and prove theorems to answer these questions?

      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The applied mathematician is interested in these kinds of questions:

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>

  <subsection xml:id="interesting-examples">
    <title>Interesting Examples</title>
    <p>
      We want to know the behaviour of solutions of DEs.
      Several examples in this section give the lay of the land.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <me>
          \frac{d^2f}{dt^2} + 9 f = 0
        </me>
        <p>
          This is solved by <m>\sin 3t</m> and also by <m>\cos 3t</m>.
          Moreover, any linear combination <m>a\sin 3t + b \cos 3t</m> is a solution.
          In a second order equation,
          we often expect two linearly independent solutions and the general solution is a linear combination of the two linearly independent solutions.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <me>
          \frac{dy}{dt} = t \sqrt{y}
        </me>
        <p>
          This is solved by <m>y = (\frac{t^2}{4} + c)^2</m>,
          which is a nice family with one real parameter.
          However, this is also solved by <m>y=0</m>,
          even though it isn't in the family.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An extraneous solutions to a DE, one which fall outside families with parameters,
          is called <term>singular solution</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <me>
          t \frac{dy}{dt} = 4y
        </me>
        <p>
          This is solved by <m>y = ct^4</m>,
          which is another reasonable family.
          However, there is a strange, singular solution.
          <me>
            y(t) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} -t^4 \amp  t \leq 0 \\ t^4 \amp  t>0 \end{matrix} \right.
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The derivatives of this function line up at the origin,
          so the function is of class <m>C^1</m>
          (actually <m>C^3</m>, if you work it out).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <me>
          \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{-x}{y}
        </me>
        <p>
          The curve <m>x^2 + y^2 = c</m> solves this equation implicitly.
          We could break this up into two functions,
          but its much more natural to leave it as an implicit locus,
          in this case,
          a circle.
          This is very typical:
          often solutions are left in an implicit form as loci,
          even though in theory we always look for functions <m>y = f(x)</m>.
          Also notice in this example that only non-negative <m>c</m> values are allowed in this family of solutions.
          There is no guarantee that all values of a parameter will lead to reasonable solutions.

    <title>The Pessimistic Outlook</title>
    <p>
      In some sense,
      a DE is an mathematical application of the scientific method.
      Often an observation about a phenomenon can be expressed as a relationship between a function and its derivative,
      such as the observation of percentage growth.
      The DE, then, is the hypothesis born of observation.
      If we can find the solution,
      it gives us a predictive model of the phenomenon, which we can test.
      If the solution matches the observed behaviour,
      we conclude the DE model is relatively reliable;
      if the solution diverges from the observed behaviour,
      we discard or amend the DE.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way, DEs allow the modelling many phenomena:
      popluations, radioactive decay,
      cooling, disease, metabolish,
      newtonian motion with friction,
      chemical reactions, gravity, predaor-prey models,
      hamiltonian mechanics, quantum mechanics, interest,
      bacterial growth, neuron firing,
      ecology, mixtures, draining,
      series circuits, suspended cables, and many, many more.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, for all this power and utility, DEs are terribly difficult to solve.
      The sad truth is that we can exactly solve only a very small portion of them.
      Due to this limitation,
      many techniques are developed to understand approximate solutions or infer information about solutions indirectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition,
      many DEs have solutions which are entirely new functions.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <me>
          \frac{dy}{dt} = e^{-t^2} \implies y = \int e^{-t^2}dt + C
        </me>
        <p>
          This integrand is a <m>C^\infty</m> function,
          so the anti-derivative exists,
          but there is no name for it in the elementary functions.
          This is not uncommon.
          Often we will <sq>solve</sq> a differential equation by simply naming the solution with a new name,
          since it is an entirely new function.
        </p>
      </statement>
