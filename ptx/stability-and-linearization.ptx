    <title>Stability</title>
    <p>
      Coming from applied mathematics,
      the language of stability is a very useful language for talking about DEs.
      We again think of a general autonomous DE as a population model.
      <me>
        \frac{dp}{dt} = f(p)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We defined steady states when we did phase-line analysis:
      these were roots of the function <m>f(p)</m> and hence values of <m>p</m> where the rate of change is zero.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The steady states of an autonomous DE are classified by their <term>stability</term>
          A steady state <m>P</m> is <term>stable</term>
          if <m>p(t) \rightarrow P</m> when the initial value is close to <m>P</m>.
          We can also call these steady states <term>attractors</term>.
          In the phase line diagram, the trajectories points toward such states.
          Similar, we can call a steady state
          <term>stable or attractive from above or below</term>
          if only one of the trajectories points towards the steady state.
          If both trajectories point away,
          the steady state is <term>unstable</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>

    <title>Linearization</title>
    <p>
      Once we have identified a steady state of a DE system,
      we often are only interested in the behaviour of slight perterbations from the steady state.
      This is the behaviour that stability capture:
      whether we approach or diverge from the steady state when we start a small distance away.
      If <m>P</m> is a steady state,
      the we can define a new function <m>q(t) = p(t) - P</m>.
      A change of variables results in
      <me>
        \frac{dq}{dt} = f(P + q)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we expand <m>f</m> as a taylor series centered at <m>p</m>,
      this becomes
      <me>
        \frac{dq}{dt} = f(P + q) = f(P) + f^\prime(P) (P+q -P) + \ldots = f^\prime(P) q + \ldots
      </me>.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>linearization</term> of the DE at the steady state <m>P</m> is
          <me>
            \frac{dq}{dt} = f^\prime(P) q
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The solution to the linearized DE is
      <me>
        q(t) = q_0 e^{f^\prime(P) t}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular,
      this linearized solution is either exponential growth or decay,
      depending on the sign of <m>f^\prime(P)</m>.
      Therefore, the sign of <m>f^\prime(P)</m> determines the stability:
      positive and the solution is unstabe,
      negative and the solution is stable.
      This can also be seen in the phase line,
      since the sign of the derivative can indicate the trajectories on either side of the steady state.
      If <m>f^\prime(P) = 0</m>,
      then the stability is determined by the higher order terms of the taylor series expansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      For now, there isn't much more we will do with this linearization.
      However, it is worth introducing here as a theme since it is so central to applied mathematics.
      Linear equations are almost always the first kind of DE that we try to use,
      typically since they have elegant and accessible solutions.
      Everything else gets simply referred to a <sq>non-linear</sq>;
      in many ways,
      <sq>non-linear</sq> is a synonmy for annoying and complication.
      However, linear models only go so far and often the non-linearity holds the key to understanding a model.
      Even so, we will often try to understand the linear part and then figure out how to add in the non-linearity in a reasonable fashion to add subtleties to various models.
