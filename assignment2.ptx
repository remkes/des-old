    <li>
      Recall that <m>\imath</m> is the complex number with the
      property <m>\imath^2 = -1</m>. Treating <m>\imath</m> as just
      an ordinary constant, prove that both <m>e^{\imath t}</m> and
      <m>\cos t + \imath \sin t</m> solve the differential equation
      <m>y^{\prime \prime} + y = 0</m> with initial conditions
      <m>y(0) = 1</m> and <m>y^\prime(0) = \imath</m>. Second order
      linear constant coefficient equations have unique solutions
      (which you can assume here, even though I haven't proved it
      in the course). Use this fact about unique solutions to
      conclude an alternate proof for Euler's formula. (8)

      Let <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> be real constants and let 
      <me>
        L = a \frac{d^2}{dt^2} + b \frac{d}{dt} + c
      </me>
      be a second order linear differential operator in the variable
      <m>t</m>. (8)

      <p><ol>
        <li>
          If a function <m>f</m> satisfies <m>L f = 0</m> and <m>L
          (tf) = 0</m>, prove that the function must satisfy the
          following first order equation.
          <me>
            \frac{df}{dt} = \frac{-b}{2a} f(t) 
          </me>
        </li>
        <li>
          Consider any second order linear constant coefficient
          homogeneous differential equation where the characteristic
          equation has a repeated root <m>r</m>. Verify that the
          initial solution <m>f = e^{rt}</m> satisfies the equation in
          the previous part of this question.
