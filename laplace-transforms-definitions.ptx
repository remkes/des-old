    In functional analysis, we have a group of operations on functions
    called transforms. These operations act on a certain set of
    functions and transform then into new functions: through the
    transforms, we see behaviour that was previously hidden. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The changes due to transforms are often radical: the resulting
    functions do not look anything like the originals. We can think
    of transforms as radically altering the environment of the
    function, so that everything changes into a surprisingly different
    form.
  </p>
  <p>
    For those who like to think in linear algebra terms, we can think
    of the space of functions defined on some interval in <m>\RR</m>
    as a vector space. (The specific vector space depends on the
    interval and the class of function: continuous,
    piecewise-continuous, differentiable, etc). In this language,
    transforms are nothing but interesting linear transformations
    between vector spaces of functions.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this section, we study the Laplace transform. It applies to a
    functions with certain controls on their asymptotic growth, which
    we now define.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A function <m>f(t)</m> defined on <m>[0, \infty)</m> is of
        <term>exponential order c</term> if <m>\exists M > 0 \ \
        \exists T > 0</m> such that <m>\forall t > T \ \ \ |f(t)| \lt
        Me^{ct}</m>. Asymptotically, this is equivalent to <m>f \in
        \calO(e^{ct})</m> for some real positive <m>c</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    If <m>f(t)</m> is a piecewise-continuous function on <m>[0,
    \infty)</m> of exponential order <m>c</m>, then its Laplace
    transform is
    <me>
      \calL \{ f(t) \} (s) = \int_0^\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt
    </me>.
    The Laplace transform is defined on the domain <m>(c, \infty)</m>.
    We can check that this improper integral converges for all <m>s
    \in (c, \infty)</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The restriction of exponential order is a fairly reasonable one:
    in differential equations and applied mathematics, we are rarely
    concerned with functions which grow faster than the exponential.
  </p>
  <p>
    The choice of variables is standard for Lapalce transforms. We
    will often refer to the original functions as functions in the
    <m>t</m>-domain, and to their transforms as functions in the
    <m>s</m>-domain. In addition, if <m>f(t)</m> and <m>g(t)</m> are
    function in the <m>t</m>-domain, we will also often write
    <m>F(s)</m> and <m>G(s)</m> for their Laplace transforms. By
    convention, we use lower case for the <m>t</m>-domain and
    uppercase for the matching function in the <m>s</m>-domain. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Most of the following examples are sub-exponential, so we expect a
    transform on <m>(0, \infty)</m>. Note that we are never
    guaranteed convergence at <m>0</m>.

        Our first observation about Laplace transforms is simply their
        strangeness. Powers of <m>t</m> turn into inverse powers of
        <m>s</m>, but exponentials (which are very different) turn
        into very similar reciprocals.

        We said that Lapalce transforms exist for piecewise-continuous
        functions with a certain exponential order. Here is an
        example for a piecewise continuous function and its
        transform.

        The Laplace transform is not a piecewise function,
        even thought the original was.

        The Laplace transform of <m>t^n</m> for <m>n \in \ZZ</m>
        involved factorials, so it is not surprising that
        <m>t^\alpha</m> for non-integer <m>\alpha</m> involves the
        extension of the factorial: the <m>\Gamma</m> function.

        Finally, Laplace transforms are defined for some important
        oscillating functions, such as the trigonometric functions and
        the Bessel functions.
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \calL \{ \sin t \} \amp = \int_0^\infty e^{-st} \sin t dt
            = \frac{1}{s^2+1}

          <mrow>
            \calL \{ \cos t \} \amp = \frac{s}{s^2+1}

          <mrow>
            \calL \{ J_0(kt) \} \amp = \frac{1}{\sqrt{s^2 + k^2}}

        Again, note the strangeness: even starting with transcendental
        and non-elementary functions like these, the Lapalce
        transforms are rational and algebraic functions.

    As an aside, I mentioned at the start of this chapter that the
    Laplace transform is not the only transform in mathematics. The
    most well-known and well-used transform is the Fourier transform.
    It uses the same conventions about the <m>s</m> and the <m>t</m>
    domains, but it applies to complex valued functions. In place of
    the <m>e^{-st}</m> term in the Laplace transform, the Fourier
    transform uses the complex <m>e^{-2\pi \imath st}</m>.

        The <term>Fourier transform</term>
        of a function <m>f(s)</m> is given by this integral.
        <me>
          \hat{f}(s) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t) e^{-2\pi \imath t s}
          dt
