  <title>Key Examples</title>
  <p>
    There are a number of important motiavting examples.
    We first look to biology,
    where the interaction of species produces systems of linear equations.
    The Lokta-Volterra equations model predator-prey relationships.
    Let <m>p(t)</m> be the population of prey and <m>q(t)</m> be the population of predators.
    These equations describe the interactions between the two derivatives.
    <md>
      <mrow>\frac{dp}{dt} \amp  = ap - bpq</mrow>
      <mrow>\frac{dq}{dt} \amp  = cpq - dq</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    The coefficients <m>a,b,c</m> and <m>d</m> are all positive coefficients.
    <m>a</m> is a natural birth rate for the prey,
    <m>b</m> is the death of prey due to predation,
    <m>c</m> is the growth rate of predators due to predation,
    and <m>d</m> is the natural death rate of predators.
    The product <m>pq</m> represents the number of interactions between predators and prey.
    The Lokta-Volterra system is a classic system in mathematical biology;
    however, its non-linearity makes it difficult to solve and the solutions are not expressible by elementary functions.
    To help understanding the system without having to actually calculate difficult solutions,
    we will develop qualitative methods of analysis.

    Mathematical biology has many systems similar to Lokta-Volterra.
    If <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are two species competing for the same resources,
    we have a similar two-equation DE model.
    <md>
      <mrow>\frac{dp}{dt} \amp  = a_pp\left(1- \frac{p + b_p q}{c_p} \right)</mrow>
      <mrow>\frac{dq}{dt} \amp  = a_qp\left(1- \frac{q + b_q p}{c_q} \right)</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    The coefficients <m>a_p</m> and <m>a_q</m> are the natural growth rates of each species,
    <m>c_p</m> and <m>c_q</m> are the carrying capacities of the environment for each species,
    and <m>b_p</m> and <m>b_q</m> measure the effects of competition.
  </p>
  <p>
    Infection disease models are also systems of differential equations.
    The SIR model is a good example.
    In a population exposed to an infection disease,
    let <m>S</m> be the susceptible population,
    <m>I</m> the infected population,
    and <m>R</m> the recovered population.
    The model is this system of three differential equations.
    <md>
      <mrow>\frac{dS}{dt} \amp  = -a I S</mrow>
      <mrow>\frac{dI}{dt} \amp  = a I S - b I</mrow>
      <mrow>\frac{dR}{dt} \amp  = b I</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    Here <m>a</m> measures the increase in infection due to interactions between the infected and susceptible population and <m>b</m> measure the natural recovery of the infected population.
    Many similar models exist to model infection disease.

    Mathematical biology only gets more complex and involved from here.

    Examples exist in other disciplines as well.
    If we go back to physics, we can look at the physics of the coupled spring.
    In this sytem,
    we have a mass <m>m_1</m> on a spring with spring constant <m>k_1</m> attached to a fixed object.
    Then we have a second mass <m>m_2</m> attached to the first by a spring with spring constant <m>k_2</m>.
    Analyzing the forces and using Newton's law of motion results in a system of DEs.
    <md>
      <mrow>m_1x_1^{\prime \prime} \amp  = - k_1x_1 + k_2(x_2 - x_1)</mrow>
      <mrow>m_2x_2^{\prime \prime} \amp  = -k_2(x_2-x_1)</mrow>
    </md>
