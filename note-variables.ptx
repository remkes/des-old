  <title>A Note on Variables</title>
  <p>
    Various branches and subdisiplines of mathematics have their own
    notation conventions. It's useful to make you aware of these
    conventions, so that you are equiped to understand the
    mathematical expression efficiently.

  <p>
    In differential equations, the name of the independent variable is
    almost always either <m>x</m> or <m>t</m>.  <m>x</m> is
    conventional, of course, in calculus; it is also useful for
    certain geometric interpretation where we want <m>x</m> and
    <m>y</m> to correspond to the familiar cartesian axes. I will
    use <m>x</m> as the independnet variable at certain points in the
    courses, particularly when I use these geometric techniques.

    The vast majority of differential equations that I want to solve
    involve time derivatives; therefore, <m>t</m> is often the most
    natural choice for the independent variable.  I will use <m>t</m>
    instead of <m>x</m> for the majority of this course.  Often in the
    literature, a derivative in Newton's notation (<m>f^\prime</m>)
    implies that the independent variable is time.
