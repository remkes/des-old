          Let <m>a(t)</m>, <m>b(t)</m>, <m>c(t)</m> and <m>f(t)</m> be
          functions. A <term>second order linear differential
          equation</term> is an equation of the form
          <me>
            a(t) \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + b(t) \frac{dy}{dt} + c(t) y = f(t)
          </me>.
          As with the first order case, this is called
          <term>homogeneous</term> if <m>f(t) = 0</m>.

          A <term>second order linear differential operator</term>
          is an operator of the form.
          <me>
            L = a(t) \frac{d^2}{dt^2} + b(t) \frac{d}{dt} + c(t)
          </me>.
          In operator notation, a second order linear differential
          equation is <m>Ly = f(t)</m>. The principles of linearity
          and superposition defined for first order equation in <xref
          ref="section-linear-des" /> still hold for higher-order
          linear equations.

    <p>
      General second order equations are usually impossible to solve
      with direct methods; I will focus almost exclusively on second
      order linear differential equations in this course. Even though,
      however, present substantial challenge in general. I need to 
      restrict even further, to the simplest case where the
      coefficient functions are constant.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>a,b,c \in \RR</m>. A <term>second order constant
          coefficient linear operator</term> has the form
          <me>
            L = a \frac{d^2}{dt^2} + b \frac{d}{dt} + c
          </me>.
          The corresponding homogeneous equation is <m>Ly=0</m> and
          the corresponding non-homogeneous equation is
          <m>Ly=f(t)</m>. o avoid writing a lengthy name over and
          over again, I'll write SOCCLDE for a second order constant
          coefficient linear differential equation. Note that though
          the coefficients of the linear equation are constant, the
          function in the non-homogenous equation, <m>f(t)</m>, does
          not need to be a constant.

    <p>
      Second order constant coefficient linear differential equations,
      even with their very restricted form, are quite important for
      applied mathematics. They give models to understand both
      harmonic motion and alternating current electric curcuits, among
      other applications. I'm going to start with harmonic motion and
      use that application to explain and motivate the those theory of
      SOCCLDEs. Harmonic motion (in one dimension) can describe a
      variety of phenomena: an object attached to a spring, a pendulum
      or swing, a shock in a bicycle or car, a string on a musical
      instrument, the sway of structures in wind, a trampoline, a
      drum, etc.

    <title>Harmonic Motion</title>
    <p>
      I want to consider a system with one dimension of movement
      described by a function <m>x(t)</m>. In harmonic motion, the
      system has some rest state where there are no forces; by
      convention, the rest state will always be at <m>x=0</m> and will
      be a steady state of the system. If the system is disturbed from
      its rest, there is an elastic force that wants to return the
      system to its rest state. Hooke's Law gives the elastic for: 
      <m>F = -kx(t)</m>. Then, using Newton's first law, I can write
      this force as <m>F = ma = m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2}</m>. Equating
      these two expressions for the elastic force produces a
      differential equation. 
      <md>
        <mrow>
          F \amp = -k x(t)
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          F \amp = ma = m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          -kx(t) \amp = m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          m\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + k x(t) \amp = 0
        </mrow>
      </md>
      This is homogeneous SOCCLDE with <m>a=m</m>, <m>b=0</m>
      and <m>c=k</m>. If there are no other forces involved, this is
      the simplest possible situation for harmomic motion and there
      are two solutions.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          x_1(t) \amp = \sin \left( \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} x \right)

          x_2(t) \amp = \cos \left( \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} x \right)
        </mrow>
      </md>
      Since I know these two homogeneous solution, I can use
      superposition to produce a general solution by taking any linear
      combination of these two solutions. For any two numbers <m>A,B
      \in \RR</m>, this is the general solution:
      <me>
        x(t) = A \sin \left( \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} t \right) + B \cos
        \left( \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} t \right)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an aside: if I want, If a sine and cosine function share the
      same period, I can express the sums of the two trig functions as
      a single way. There is a relatively obscure but useful trig
      identity that show how to accomplish this. 
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition-wave-combination">
      <statement>
        The sum of a sine and cosine wave with the same frequency (but
        possibly different amplitude) is still a sinusoidal wave. The
        new amplitude is a pythagorean combination of the original
        amplutide and the way is shifted by some angle <m>\phi</m>
        Explicitly:
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \amp a \sin t + b \cos t = \sqrt{a^2+b^2} \sin (t + \phi)
            \amp \amp \text{ where } \amp \amp \phi = \arcsin
            \left( \frac{b}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}} \right)
          </mrow>
        </md>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      This identity shows me that combinations of sine and cosine, at
      least when they share a period, are still just a single
      sinusoidal wve wave. This is very useful for the general
      solution to simple harmonic motion: even the linear combination
      will still produce the expected behaviour of sinusoidal
      oscillations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hooke's Law is the starting point for understanding harmonic
      motion. However, these SOCCLDEs have no <m>b</m> term. I should
      wonder: what could <m>b</m> be?  This <m>b</m> is a coefficient
      of the first derivative, the velocity of the system. Velocity
      causes friction in the system, and the greater the velocity the
      greater the friction. Hooke's law was an idealization which
      ignored friction; by adding in a non-zero <m>b</m> coefficient,
      I account for friction in the harmonic system. Again, I will
      set up Hooke's law as a force quation using Newton's laws of
      motion, but now include a friction term.

      </md>
      Harmonic systems with friction are called <term>damped harmonic
      systems</term>; systems without friction are
      <term>undamped</term>.  The solution to the undamped system was
      never ending sinusoidal oscillation. This makes sense from the
      perspective of conservation of energy: without friction to
      remove energy from the system, the oscillations will continue
      for ever. Frication removes energy, so I that friction should
      cause the oscillations to eventually slow down. I expect the
      solutions to show decay in the amplitude of the sine wave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having used friction to interpret the constant <m>b</m>, the
      only piece that remains to interpret is the function <m>f(t)</m>
      in a non-homogeneous SOCCLDe. In the harmonic motion
      intepretation so far, all these terms in the equation are terms
      of force. If the equation is to make any sense, <m>f(t)</m> must
      also be a force. However, <m>f(t)</m> doesn't directly relate to
      the position at all: the dependent variable <m>x</m> doesn't
      show up. Therefore, <m>f(t)</m> must be a force which is not
      dependent on the current position, velocity or acceleration of
      the system. The only option is an external form on the system.
      In this way, homogenous equations represent a system free of
      external forces and non-homogeneous equations represent a system
      under the influence of an external force.

    <title>Alternating Current Circuits</title>
    <p>
      Before moving on to actual solution techinques, I want to talk
      about the second major interpretations of SOCCLDEs: alternating
      current circuits. The DE that will result is exactly the same as
      that for harmonic motion, but the interpretation of each of the
      coefficients is quite different. Instead of a position function
      <m>x(t)</m>, the system describes a charge function <m>q(t)</m>;
      the movement of that charge will be the alternating current. In
      this system, there are four components to a circuit: resistors,
      capacitors, inductors and an external electro-motive force. Let
      me describe these each in turn. 
    </p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>
        Resistors allow for energy leaving the system and they
        represent the resistance to energy flow. The resistance is
        written <m>R</m> and measured in ohms. It acts like friction
        in the mechanical system in that it wants to slow down the
        flow of current. Resistance will result in a decrease in current
        over time, if there is no external forcing. Resistors
        represent the devices powered by the circuit, whatever those
        devices are. As the parallel of friction, resistance should
        show up as the coefficient of <m>\frac{dq}{dt}</m>. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Capacitors are storage devices for electrical energy in
        electric fields. They have a measurement <m>c</m> called
        capacitance, which has units of farads (coloumbs per volt).
        They stabilize alternating current flow; as such, they can be
        see as controlling the natural way in which current flows.
        Thise idea (up to a reciprocal) aligns with the idae of spring
        constant, which represented the stiffness of the spring and
        controlled the natural behaviour of the harmonic system
        (before friction and external forces). As the analogue of the
        spring constant, capacitance should show up as the coefficient
        of <m>x(t)</m>. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Inductors are storage devices for electrical energy in a
        magnetic field. They have a measurement <m>L</m> called
        inductance, which has units of henrys. Inductors block
        alternating current; as such, they represent the difficulty of
        moving charge through the system. In the harmonic system, the
        difficult of moving the object was its mass (indeed, a simple
        definition of mass is a measure of how difficult it is to move
        an object). As the analogue of the mass, inductance should
        show up as the coefficient of <m>\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2}</m>
      </li>
      <li>
        Electromotive forces are external forces to the system, from
        batteries or generators. They are written <m>E(t)</m> and
        have units of volts. Like the forces that add movement to a
        harmonic system, these electromotive forces add charge to a
        circuit. Matching up most directly with the harmonic system,
        the electromotive force should be the non-homogeneous function
        in a non-homogeneous DE. 
      </li>
      <li>
        To give a complete account of the units, charge is written
        <m>q</m> and measured in coloumbs. The movement of charge is
        current, represented by the derivative <m>\frac{dq}{dt}</m>.
        The SOCCLDE that models an alternating current is 
        <me>
          L \frac{d^2 q}{dt^2} + R \frac{dq}{dt} + \frac{1}{c} q = E(t)
        </me>.
        If there is no resistance and no electromotive force, the
        solution is sinusoidal oscillation as before (hence
        <em>alternating</em> current). Under resistance, where there is
        energy leaving the system, I expect damped oscillations. 
      </li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>
      The parallel of harmonic motion/alternating currents is a great
      example of a common occurence in applied mathematics and the
      study of differential equations: the same differential equation
      can describe a variety of seemingly unrelated systems. I find it
      quite fascinating to think of alternating currents as an
      electro-magnetic analogue of springs. Since alternating current
      is so ubiquitous in the world, this mental model of what is
      going on with electricity gives me a handle on the strange
      system of power plants, wires, and devices that affect so much
      of my life.

    <title>Solving SOCCLDEs</title>
    <p>
      Now that I have described the two most important
      interpretations, I need to move on to actually solving SOCCLDEs.
      I'll make heavy use of the differential operator notation, so
      let me remind you of the general form of the second order
      constant coefficient operator. 
      <me>
        L = a \frac{d^2}{dt^2} + b \frac{d}{dt} + c
      </me>.
      Then the DE that I am trying to solve is
      <me>
        Ly = f(t) 
      </me>
      for some (probably continuous) <m>f(t)</m>. How do I even start?
      One common strategy in DEs is to look at easier but similar
      equations and see if the type of solutions from the easier case
      can extend. The easier case, here, is first-order linear
      equations. In particular, the homogeneous constant-coefficient
      first order case, <m>\frac{dy}{dt} = \alpha y</m>, is just the
      standard percentage growth equation. The solution is an
      exponential function <m>y = e^{\alpha t}</m>. Therefore, I'm
      going to guess that exponential functions might also solve the
      second-order case, at least for homogeneous equations. I will
      simply assume that the solution to <m>Ly =0</m> has the form
      <m>y = e^{r t}</m> for some <m>r \in \RR</m>. If there is such a
      solution, what must <m>r</m> be?  To find out, I'll put the
      assumed formed into the DE and investigate. This is also a
      common strategy for DEs: assume (hopefully with some
      justification) that the solution must have a particular form,
      then put that form into the differential equation and see what
      the details must be.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll calculate the derivative of the proposed solution so that I
      can calculate the action of the differential operator.

      If <m>Ly = 0</m>, then the differential equation equation is
      only satisfied if <m>ar^2 + br + c = 0</m>, since <m>e^{rt}</m>
      is not the constant zero function. This is an accomplishment:
      I've turned a differential equation into an algebraic equation. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          This equation is called the <term>characteristic
          equation</term> of the SOCCLDE.

      </me>
      Recall that the term <m>b^2 -4ac</m> in a quadratic is called
      the discriminant; the sign of the discriminat controls the roots
      of the quadratic. There are three cases. 
    </p>
    <p><ol>
      <li>
        <m>b^2 -4ac > 0 \implies</m> two real roots.

        of the few places where I will need the material from <xref
        ref="section-complex-numbers" />. 
      </li>
    </ol></p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsection-two-real-roots">
    <title>Case 1: Two Real Roots</title>
    <p>
      In this case, the solutions are real exponential functions
      <m>e^{r_1 t}</m> and <m>e^{r_2 t}</m>. Since the roots are
      distinct, these are linearly independent solutions (neither
      exponential function is a multiple of the other). I can simply
      check that they satisfy the DE.
      <me>
        L e^{rt} = e^{rt} ( ar^2 + br+ c) = 0
      </me>
      Since I expect two linearly indepedent solutions to a linear
      equation, the are no other solutions. The general solution is a
      superposition (linear combination) of the two solutions. 
      <me>
        y= Ae^{r_1 t} + Be^{r_2t}
      </me>
      The behaviour is exponential growth or decay, depending on
      whether <m>r_1</m> and <m>r_2</m> are positive or negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me return to harmonic motion. In a harmonic system, the
      spring constnat <m>k</m>, the coefficient of friction <m>b</m>
      and the mass <m>m</m> are all positive numbers: all the constant
      coefficients in the DE are positive. Looking at the general form
      of the characteristic equation again, if <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> and
      <m>c</m> are positive, I can determine the sign of the roots. In
      the solution given by the quadratic forumla
      <me>
      \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
      </me>
      since the discriminant is positive, I can make the following
      calculation.
      <me>
        \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \leq \sqrt{b^2} = b 
      </me>
      The numerator of the fraction is obviously negative if I choose
      negative for the <m>\pm</m>. However, if I choose positive, then
      the term I am adding to <m>-b</m>, by the above inequatliy, is
      less than <m>b</m>; I am not adding enough to make the numerator
      positive. Therefore, in both cases, the numerator is negative.
      The denominator is <m>2a</m> and I assumed all the coefficients
      were positive, so the whole fraction must be negative.
      Therefore, for harmonic motion (and equivalently for alternating
      circuit), if there are real roots, they must be negative. This
      implies that both solutions are exponential decay. This means
      that the harmonic system will decay to equilibrium with no
      oscillations. The discriminant condition is <m>b^2 > 4ac</m>
      and recall that <m>b</m> was the coefficient of friction. The
      case of two real roots only happens if <m>b</m> is large enough
      (larger than <m>4ac</m>). Exponential decay is the behaviour
      that results from a surplus of friction. There is too much
      friction even to have oscillations: the system only displays
      exponential decay to equilibrium. These situations are called
      <term>overdamped</term> harmonic systems.

          two unknowns in the general form, two initial conditions are
          required for a specific solution.) 
          In this case, the system is <m>A+B=1</m> and
          <m>A-B=0</m>, which is solved by <m>A = B = \frac{1}{2}</m>.
          The final solution is <m>\frac{1}{2} e^t + \frac{1}{2}
          e^{-t}</m>. This is just the exponential definition of <m>\cosh
          t</m>! Indeed, I could have prediced this solution if I
          tried to interpret the original DE. What does this DE ask?
          It asks: what function returns to itself after two
          derivatives?  The hyperbolic functions are the unique
          functions that have this behaviour, so they must be the
          solutions to this DE. (Hyperbolic sine is also a solution
          for a different set of initial condition.) 
        </p>
        <p>
          I could have made different choices for the initial
          linearly independent solutions by taking <m>y_1 = \cosh
          t</m> and <m>y_2 = \sinh t</m>. The linearily independent
          solutions are not unique. This can be expressed nicely in
          linear algebra language. The <term>solution space</term> for
          this DE is the span of two functions. Such a solution space
          may have many bases: many choices of two functions which
          span the space. The set <m>\{e^t, e^{-t}\}</m> is one basis
          for the solution space. The set <m>\{\cosh t, \sinh t\}</m>
          is another basis for the solution space.

    <title>Case 2: Repeated Real Roots</title>
    <p>
      If the characteristic equation factors as <m>(x-r)^2</m>, then
      <m>r</m> is a repeated real root (with value
      <m>\frac{-b}{2a}</m>). The result is  only one exponential
      solution: <m>e^{rt}</m>. This is a problem, since I expect two
      linearly independent solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solution to this problem is a bit strange, but turns out to
      be a common trick for linear equations: multiply by the
      independent variable. The second solution is <m>te^{rt}</m>. I
      can demonstrate that this work by puting <m>t e^{rt}</m> into
      the DE, simply verifying that it is a solution. (The fact that
      <m>r = \frac{-b}{2a}</m> is necessary here; I use it in the
      second last line of the algebra.)

      (Now there are two linearly indepedent solutions: <m>y_1 =
      e^{rt}</m> and <m>y_2 = te^{rt}</m>. I already understand the
      first, since it is similar to the case of two distinct real
      roots. For harmonic systems where the coefficients are all
      positive, , <m>r - \frac{-b}{2a} \lt 0</m>. Therefore, as
      before, the first solution is exponential decay.
      The second solution is also exponential decay, since
      asymptotically the <m>e^{-rt}</m> dominates over <m>t</m>.
      However, it allows for one oscillation before decay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation of repeated roots happens when <m>b^2 = 4ac</m>,
      so that the <m>\pm</m> disappears from the solutions to the
      quadratic. For harmonic systems, this only happens if the
      friction is exactly <m>b = \sqrt{4ac}</m> (since this leads to
      <m>b^2 - 4ac = 0</m>. This is the exact friction that allows
      for this one oscillation before exponential decay. These
      systems are called <term>critically damped</term>. This is the
      tipping point for friction: there is exactly enough friction to
      result in exponential decay.

    <title>Case 3: Complex Roots</title>
    <p>
      The roots are complex numbers when <m>b^2 - 4ac \lt 0</m>. Here
      is where I need a little bit of arithmetic for complex numbers
      to understand the solutions (as well as the use of Euler's
      formula). I can factor <m>\imath</m> out of the square root to
      get a real root. 
      <me> 
        r = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} = \frac{-b}{2a} \pm
        \imath \frac{\sqrt{4ac-b^2}}{2a} 
      </me> 
      The roots are a pair of complex numbers <m>x \pm y \imath</m>
      with the real part <m>x = \frac{-b}{2a}</m> and imaginary part
      <m>y = \frac{ \sqrt{4ac-b^2}}{2a}</m>. They are a conjugate
      pair (each is the conjugate of the other). This is expected
      behaviour: the complex roots to a real quadratic always come as
      a conjugate pair. To write this more succinctly, I'll define
      two new constants.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \amp \alpha = \frac{-b}{2a} \amp \amp \beta =
          \frac{\sqrt{4ac-b^2}}{2a}
        </mrow>
      </md>
      Then the complex roots are described via these constants:
      <m>\alpha \pm \imath \beta</m>. The solutions to the DE are
      <me>
        e^{(\alpha \pm \imath \beta)t} = e^{\alpha t} e^{\pm \imath
        \beta t}
      </me>.
      What do these complex functions means? The <m>e^{\alpha t}</m>
      term is fine, it is just a real exponential. The complex
      exponential is understood through Euler's formula (<xref
      ref="prop-eulers-formula"  /> in <xref
      ref="section-complex-numbers" />).

        e^{\alpha t} e^{\pm \imath \beta t} = e^{\alpha t} ( \cos
        (\beta t) \pm \imath \sin (\beta t))
      </me>
      These solutions are still problematic because they involve
      complex numbers. I am trying to solve a real system with real
      coefficient and I want real solutions. To find them, I need to
      take clever linear combinations (over <m>\CC</m>!) of the two
      solutions.

        <mrow>
          \frac{1}{2\imath } e^{\alpha t}(\cos \beta t + \imath \sin

      On the basis of these linear combinations, I conclude that the

      The complex numbers, via Euler's formula, product sine and
      cosine instead of exponential growth or decay. In a harmonic
      system, this behaviour happens when
      <m>b^2 \lt 4ac</m>, that is, when friction is small enough. If
      there is some friction, but not too much, harmonic systems have
      the oscillations that we expect. The real exponential term will
      be decay (<m>\alpha \lt 0</m> in harmonic systems since all the
