        <p>
          In operator notation,
          a second order linear differential equation is <m>Ly = f(t)</m>.
          The principles of linearity and superposition defined for first order equation in <xref ref="linear-des">Section</xref>
          still hold for higher-order linear equations.

      Even though we look to linear equations for solvable second order DEs, linear equations are still very tricky,
      particularly if the coefficient functions are complicated.
      We need to restrict even further,
      to the simplest case where the coefficient functions are constant.

          The corresponding homogeneous equation is <m>Ly=0</m> and the corresponding non-homogeneous equation is <m>Ly=f(t)</m>.
          To avoid writing a lengthy name over and over again, I'll write SOCCLDE for a second order constant coefficient linear differential equation.

    <p>
      Second order constant coefficient linear differential equations,
      even with their very restricted form,
      are quite important for applied mathematics.
      They give models to understand both harmonic motion and alternating current electric curcuits.
      The harmonic motion interpretation is our starting point.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection xml:id="harmonic-motion">
    <title>Harmonic Motion</title>
    <p>
      Hooke's Law for a position function <m>x(t)</m> in a harmonic system is the equation <m>F = -kx(t)</m>.
      We interpret this equation in terms of Newton's law of motion.
      <md>
        <mrow>F \amp  = -k x(t)</mrow>
        <mrow>m a(t) + k x(t) \amp  = 0</mrow>
        <mrow>m\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + k x(t) \amp  = 0</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      This gives us a homogeneous SOCCLDE with <m>a=m</m>,
      <m>b=0</m> and <m>c=k</m>.
      This is the simplest possible spring and there are two solutions.
      <me>
        x_1(t) = \sin \left( \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} x \right) \hspace{2cm} x_2(t) = \cos \left( \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} x \right)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since we can solve the homogeneous case,
      superposition applies and we can get a general solution.
      <me>
        x(t) = A \sin \left( \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} t \right) + B \cos \left( \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} t \right)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Note there are two parameters and the solution is a
      <em>linear combination</em>
      of the two independent solutions.
      That's expected for a second order equation.
      We expect two linearly independent solutiolns
      (neither is a constant multiple of the other)
      and the full family of homogeneous solutions is all linear combinations of the two solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an aside:
      the sums of <m>\sin</m> and <m>\cos</m> can be expressed as a single sinusoidal wave.
      We are helped by a relatively obscure but useful identity (if <m>a \geq 0)</m>.
      <me>
        a \sin t + b \cos t = \sqrt{a^2+b^2} \sin (t + \phi) \hspace{1cm} \text{ where }  \hspace{1cm} \phi = \arcsin \left( \frac{b}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}} \right)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This identity lets us see linear combinations of sine and cosine as a single wave.
      In particular,
      the amplitude of a linear combination is the pythagorian combination
      <m>\sqrt{a^2+b^2}</m> of the original amplitudes and frequency is altered,
      though the wave is shifted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hooke's Law is a nice starting point for understanding harmonic motion.
      However, these SOCCLDEs have no <m>b</m> term.
      We can wonder: what should <m>b</m> be?
      This <m>b</m> is a coefficient of the first derivative,
      the velocity of the system.
      Velocity causes friction in the system,
      and the greater the velocity the greater the friction.
      Hooke's law was an idealization which ignored friction;
      by adding in a non-zero <m>b</m> coefficient,
      we account for friction in the harmonic system.
      Again, we set up Hooke's law as a force quation using Newton's laws of motion.
      <md>
        <mrow>F \amp  = -k x(t) - b \frac{dx}{dt}</mrow>
        <mrow>m a(t) + b \frac{dx}{dt} + k x(t) \amp  = 0</mrow>
        <mrow>m\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + b \frac{dx}{dt} + k x(t) \amp  = 0</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Harmonic systems with friction are called
      <em>damped harmonic systems</em>.
      What do we expect out of such systems?
      The undamped system is a sine or cosine wave,
      which just oscillates forever.
      We expect that the friction should cause the oscillations to eventually slow down.
      Therefore, we expect decay in the amplitude of the sine way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now consider the non-homogeneous system.
      If we have <m>L = m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + b \frac{dx}{dt} + k x</m> where <m>m</m> is mass,
      <m>b</m> is the coefficient of friction and <m>k</m> is the spring constant,
      then what is the interpretation of <m>f(t)</m> in <m>Lx(t) = f(t)</m>?
      The term <m>Lx(t)</m> represents the force,
      since we derived it using Newton's law.
      Therefore, this must be an equation of forces and <m>f(t)</m> must be some external force on the system.
      The homogenous equation gives the behaviour of the system on its own,
      and the non-homogenous equation add the complication of external forces.

  <subsection xml:id="curcuits">
    <title>Alternating Current Circuits</title>
    <p>
      The second major interpretations of SOCCLDEs is as alternating current circuits.
      The DE that will result is exactly the same,
      but the interpretation of each of the coefficients is quite different.
      Instead of a position function <m>x(t)</m>,
      we will have a charge function <m>q(t)</m> and the movement of that charge will constitute current.
      For our purposes, we will have four components to a circuit:
      resistors, capacitors, inductors and an external electro-motive force.
      Let's quickly given an account.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Resistors allow for energy leaving the system and they represent the resistance to energy flow.
            The resistance is written <m>R</m> and measured in ohms.
            They act like friction in the mechanical system in that they want to slow down the flow of current.
            They will result in a decrease in current over time if there is no external forcing.
            Resistors represent the devices powered by the circuit,
            whatever those devices are.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Capacitors are storage devices for electrical energy in electric fields.
            They have a measurement <m>c</m> called capacitance, which has units of farads
            (coloumbs per volt).
            They stabilize alternating current flow;
            as such, they can be see as controlling the natural way in which current flows.
            They (up to a reciprocal) align with the spring constant,
            which controlled the natural behaviour of the harmonic system
            (before friction and external forces).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Inductors are storage devices for electrical energy in a magnetic field.
            They have a measurement <m>L</m> called inductance,
            which has units of henrys.
            Inductors block alternating current;
            as such, they represent the difficulty of moving charge through the system.
            In the harmonic system, the difficult of moving the object was its mass.
            Inductance takes the place of the mass term.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Electromotive forces are external forces to the system,
            from batteries or generators.
            They are written <m>E(t)</m> and have units of volts.
            Like the forces that add movement to a harmonic system,
            these electromotive forces add charge to a circuit.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            To give a complete account of the units,
            charge is written <m>q</m> and measured in coloumbs.
            The movement of charge is current,
            represented by the derivative <m>\frac{dq}{dt}</m>.
            <me>
              L \frac{d^2 q}{dt^2} + R \frac{dq}{dt} + \frac{1}{c} q = E(t)

    <title>Solving SOCCLDEs</title>
    <p>
      Now that we have the two classic interpretations in place,
      we need to move on to actually solving SOCCLDEs.
      We'll use the operator

      <m>\frac{dy}{dt} = at</m>, the solution was exponential <m>y = e^{at}</m>.
      We look for the same kind of solution here by assuming that <m>Ly =0</m> has solution <m>y = e^{r t}</m>.
      We put this potential solution in the DE.

      Recall the term <m>b^2 -4ac</m> is called the discriminant.
      In terms of the discriminat, there are three cases.

    <title>Case 1: Two Real Roots</title>
    <p>
      In this case, the solutions are normal exponential functions
      <m>e^{r_1 t}</m> and <m>e^{r_1 t}</m>.
      Since the roots are distinct,
      these are linearly independent solutions
      (neither exponential function is a multiple of the other).
      We can simply check that they satisfy the DE.
      <me>
        L e^{rt} = e^{rt} ( ar^2 + br+ c) = 0
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since we expect two linearly indepedent solutions to a linear equation,
      the are no other solutions.
      The general solution is a superposition
      (linear combination)
      of the two solutions.
      <me>
        y= Ae^{r_1 t} + Be^{r_2t}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The behaviour is this case exponential.
      If <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> are positive
      (as they are in both the major interpretations),
      then the roots are both negative,
      which means that both solutions are exponential decay.
      If we are modelling harmonic motion,
      the harmonic system decays to equilibrium with no oscillations.
      The discriminant condition is
      <m>b^2 > 4ac</m> and recall that <m>b</m> was the coefficient of friction.
      The case of two real roots only happens if <m>b</m> is large enough.
      Exponential decay is the behaviour that results from a surplus of friction.
      There is too much friction even to have oscillations:
      we only have exponential decay to equilibrium.
      We called these situations <em>overamped</em> harmonic systems.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We start with a classic example.

          </me>
        </p>

          The characteristic equation is is
          <m>r^2 -1=0</m> which has roots <m>r = \pm 1</m>.
          The solutions are <m>y=e^t</m> and <m>y=e^{-t}</m>.
          The general solution is <m>y=Ae^t + Be^{-t}</m>.
          If we have initial conditions of <m>y(0) = 1</m> and
          <m>y^\prime(0) = 0</m> then we get a system of equations for <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>:
          <m>A+B=1</m> and <m>A-B=0</m>,
          which is solved by <m>A = B = \frac{1}{2}</m>.
          The final solution is <m>\frac{1}{2} e^t + \frac{1}{2} e^{-t}</m>.
          We should notice that this is just <m>\cosh t</m>,
          and then realize that we should have predicted this solution.
          The DE asks:
          what function returns to itself after two derivatives?
          Only the hyperbolics have this behaviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          We could have made different choices for the initial linearly independent solutions by taking
          <m>y_1 = \cosh t</m> and <m>y_2 = \sinh t</m>.
          The linearily independent solutions are not unique.
          For those who know linear algebra,
          these functions form a basis for the space of solutions and it is well known that a linear space has many different bases.

  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="repeated-real-root">
    <title>Case 2: Repeated Real Roots</title>
    <p>
      If the characteristic equation factors as <m>(x-r)^2</m>,
      then <m>r</m> is a repeated real root
      (with value <m>\frac{-b}{2a}</m>).
      This gives us only one exponential solution: <m>e^{rt}</m>.
      This is a problem,
      since we expect two linearly independent solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solution to this problem is a bit strange,
      but turns out to be a common trick for linear equations:
      multiply by the independent variable.
      The second solution is <m>te^{rt}</m>.
      <md>
        <mrow>y \amp  = te^{rt}</mrow>
        <mrow>y^\prime \amp  = rte^{rt} + e^{rt}</mrow>
        <mrow>y^{\prime\prime} \amp  = r^2 t e^{rt} + 2re^{rt}</mrow>
        <mrow>a y^{\prime\prime} + a y^\prime + yc \amp  = a (r^2 t e^{rt} + 2 re^{rt}) + b (rte^{rt} + e^{rt} ) + cte^{rt}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = e^{rt} (ar^2 t + 2ar + brt + b + ct )</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = e^{rt} ( t(ar^2 + br + c) + 2ar + b)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  = e^{rt} ( t \cdot 0 + 2a \frac{-b}{2a} + b ) = 0 \hspace{1cm} \text{ Using }  r = \frac{-b}{2a}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      So we have two linearly indepedent solutions:
      <m>y_1 = e^{rt}</m> and <m>y_2 = te^{rt}</m>.
      We already understand the first,
      since it is similar to the case of two distinct real roots.
      For harmonic systems, <m>r\lt 0</m>,
      the first solution is exponential decay and it corresponds to sufficient friction.
      The second solution is also exponential decay,
      since asymptotically the <m>e^{-rt}</m> dominates over <m>t</m>.
      However, it allows for one oscillation before decay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation of repeated roots happens when <m>b^2 = 4ac</m>,
      so that the <m>\pm</m> disappears from the solutions to the quadratic.
      For harmonic systems,
      this only happens if the friction is exactly as this special value <m>b = \sqrt{4ac}</m>.
      This is the exact friction that allows for this one oscillation before exponential decay.
      We call these systems <em>critically damped</em>.
      This is the tipping point for friction:
      there is exactly enough friction to result in exponential decay.

          The characteristic equation is <m>r^2 = 2r + 1 = (r-1)^2</m>.
          The solutions are <m>y = e^t</m> and <m>y=te^t</m>,

      we define two new constants.
      <me>
        \alpha = \frac{-b}{2a} \hspace{2cm} \beta = \frac{\sqrt{4ac-b^2}}{2a}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the complex roots can be written as <m>\alpha \pm \imath \beta</m>.
      The solutions to the DE are
      <me>
        e^{(\alpha \pm \imath \beta)t} = e^{\alpha t} e^{\imath \beta t}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      What do these complex functions means?
      The <m>e^{\alpha}</m> term is fine,
      it is just a real exponential.
      The complex exponential is understood through Euler's formula
      (<xref ref="prop-eulers-formula">Proposition</xref>
      in <xref ref="complex-numbers">Section</xref>).
      <me>
        e^{\alpha t} e^{\pm \imath \beta t} = e^{\alpha t} ( \cos (\beta t) \pm \imath \sin (\beta t))
      </me>
    </p>

      These solutions are problematic because they involve complex numbers.
      We are trying to solve a real system with real coefficient and we want real solutions.
      To find them, we need to take clever linear combinations
      (over <m>\CC</m>!)
      of the two solutions.
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{1}{2} e^{\alpha t}(\cos \beta t + \imath \sin \beta t) + \frac{1}{2} e^{\alpha t}(\cos \beta t - \imath \sin \beta t) \amp  = e^{\alpha t} \cos \beta t</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{1}{2\imath } e^{\alpha t}(\cos \beta t + \imath \sin \beta t) - \frac{1}{2\imath} e^{\alpha t}(\cos \beta t - \imath \sin \beta t) \amp  = e^{\alpha t} \sin \beta</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      On the basis of these linear combinations,
      we can take the following as our linearly independent real solutions.
      <me>
        y_1 = e^{\alpha t} \sin \beta t \hspace{3cm} y_2 = e^{\alpha t} \cos \beta t
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The general,
      real-valued solutions are linear combinations of the two linearly independent solutions.
      <me>
        y = A e^{\alpha t} \sin \beta t + B e^{\alpha t} \cos \beta t
      </me>
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <me>
          y^{\prime \prime} + y = 0

          The characteristic equation is <m>r^2 +1</m> which has roots <m>\pm \imath</m>.
          Therefore <m>\alpha = 0</m> and <m>\beta = 1</m>,
          so the solutions are <m>\cos t</m> and <m>\sin t</m>,
          with the general solution of <m>A \cos t + B \sin t</m>.
          If <m>y(0) = 1</m> and <m>y^\prime(0) = 0</m>,
          substitution into the equation gives <m>A=1</m> and <m>B=0</m> for
          <m>y = \cos t</m> as the unique solution.

      The previous example could be a harmonic system,
      since its coefficients are all positive.
      The results are sinusoidal functions with exponentially decaying amplitude.
      This fits our expectations for harmonic systems.
      We expect sinusoidal behaviour,
      but with decreasing amplitude.
      The complex roots happen when <m>b^2 \lt 4ac</m>,
      meaning that friction is small enough to allow for sinusoidal behaviour.
      We call such harmonic systems <em>underdamped</em>.
