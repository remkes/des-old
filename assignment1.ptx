        Draw direction fields and integral curves for this
        differential equation. Discuss the growth and stability of the
        solutions. (Show me a small number of explicit slope
        calculations, but you don't need to do that many. You can ask
        a computer for the rest of the slope field for the
        interpretation part of the question.) (6)

        Let <m>a</m> be a real constant and consider this differential
        equation. (6).

          What do the existence and uniqueness theorems say about
          solutions to this DE with initial value <m>y(0) = a</m>?
        </li>
        <li>
          Solve the DE (with the initial condition) and describe what
          happens to the solution as it approaches <m>y=a</m>. Is the
          solution defined at a point where <m>y=a</m>, even though
          that would lead to division by zero in the DE?

        Consider this differential equation.

          Find two different solutions that satisfy the initial
          condition <m>y(0) = 0</m>. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Why does the theorem on uniqueness of solutions fail here?

        For the following differential equation, draw the phase line,
        label the trajectories, and classify the stability of the
        steady states. You may assume this is a population, so that
        <m>p \geq 0</m>. (4)

        Consider the following general form of a differential
        equation, where <m>a,b,c, \in \NN</m>. 
        <me>
          \frac{dp}{dt} = (p-1)^a(p-2)^b(p-3)^c
        </me>
        Bases on cases where <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> or <m>c</m> can be
        even or odd, classify the steady states <m>p = 1,2,3</m> as
        stable or unstable. (You have three binary choices of
        even/odd, so you should have eight total cases.) (8)
