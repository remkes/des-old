  <title>The Method of Undetermined Coefficients</title>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="secdtion-constant-coefficients">, I presented the
    method for solving homogeneous SOCCLDEs. Now I want to move on to
    the non-homogeneous case. Recall, in the interpretation as
    harmonic systems, that the non-homogeneous term <m>f(t)</m> is an
    external force on the system. I understand how a harmonic system
    wants to act when left on its own, but now I want to understand
    how it acts when subjet to some external force.
  <p>
  </p>
    There are two main techniques for solving the non-homogeneous
    case. This section introduces the first of those techniques:
    undetermined coefficients. The second method, variation of
    parameters, is more general, but undetermined coefficients is
    easier and faster for particular types of non-homogemeous terms.
    In the spirit of applications to harmonic motion, I will often
    refer to the non-homogenous part of the SOCCLDE as a forcing term.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recall, before I start, that if <m>Ly = f(t)</m> is a
    non-homogeneous SOCCLDE, I know the structure of the general
    family of solutions from superposition. I expect two linearly
    independent solutions, <m>y_1</m> and <m>y_2</m>, for the
    homogenous equaiton <m>Ly = 0</m>. I only need to look for one
    particular solution <m>y_p</m> of <m>Ly = f(t)</m>. The general
    solution is the superposition of the particular solution and a
    linear combination fo the homogeneous solutions. 
    <me>
      y = y_p + A y_1 + B y_2
    </me>
    Undetermined coefficents and variation of parameters try to find
    this particular solution <m>y_p</m>. Ihen I use the homogenous
    solutions to write the complete family..
  </p>
  <p>
    The idea of undetermined coefficients is based on the assumption
    that the forcing term is likely to dominate the system, so
    eventually the behaviour of the system should mimic the forcing
    term. Therefore, the particular solution should be the same type
    of function as the forcing term. If the forcing is polynomial, I
    look for a polynomial solution; if the forcing is exponential, I
    look for an exponential solution; and if the foring is sinusoidal,
    I look for a sinusoidal solution. Undertermined coefficients is
    going to work well for these three types of forcing terms or
    forcing terms given by products of functions of these types.
    However, it doesn't apply to other types of functions, where I
    can't reasonably expect the solution to look like the forcing
    term.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is one possible pitfall to the process: sometimes the
    forcing terms is similar to the homogeneous solutions. In this
    case, the same type of function will only solve the homogeneous
    equation, not the non-homogeneous case. The solution here is
    reminiscent of the case of repeated roots: I multiply by the
    independent variable <m>t</m> until we get something new. I'll
    show how this works out in examples.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before I get into examples, here is a useful chart. As I said,
    I want to guess a similar type of functions to the forcing. What
    is similar? This chart gives the guesses that are used in the
    process. The constants <m>C_i</m> and <m>D_j</m> need to be
    determined: these constants are the undetermined coefficients
    which give the process its name.

    With this chart, the algorithm is straightforward (if often
    lengthy in calculation). I take the appropriate guess from the
    chart put it into the DE, and try to work out the unknown
    coefficients.

        I'll need the derivatives of the guess to put it into the

        I put all the pieces into the non-homogeneous DE. 
        <me>
          0 - 3C + 2(Ct + D) = t \implies (2C-1)t + (D-3C) = 0

        This is an equation of polynomials. It is true only if botht
        the coefficients on the left are zero. The first coefficient
        lets me calculate <m>C</m>.
        <me>
          2C = 1 \implies C = \frac{1}{2} 
        </me>
        Knowing <m>C</m>, I can use the second coefficient to
        calculate <m>D</m>.
        <me>
          -3C + 2D = 0 \implies -3 \frac{1}{2} + 2 D = 0 \implies D
          = \frac{3}{4}
        </me>
        Now that I have the coefficients, I know the particular
        solution. 
        <me>
          y_p = \frac{t}{2} + \frac{3}{4} 
        </me>
        Finally, the general solution is the particular solution plus
        the homogeneous solution. 
        <me>
          y = \frac{t}{2} + \frac{3}{4} + A e^{2t} + B e^t 
        </me>
        Now I put in the initial values. First I use the initial value
        of the function. 
        <me>
          y(0) = A + B + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \implies A =
          -B 
        </me>
        Then I use the initial value for the derivative. First I need
        to calculate the derivative of the full solution.
        <me>
          y^\prime = 2Ae^{2t} + Be^t + \frac{1}{2} 
        </me>
        Then I input the initial condition. 
        <me>
          y^\prime(0) = \frac{3}{2} 
          \implies 
          2A + B + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2} \implies 2A + B - 1 = 0
        </me>
        Now I have a system of two equations from the two initial
        conditions. The solution to the system is <m>A=1</m> and
        <m>B = -1</m>. Finally, I can write the specific solution to
        the non-homogeneous initial value problem.

        The force term is <m>e^{-2t} \cos (2t)</m>, which is a product

        I need to compare coefficients. There is a cosine term on the

        First I use the second equation to isolate <m>D</m>.
        <me>
          D \amp = \frac{-8C}{13}
        </me>
        Then I substitute the value of <m>D</m> in the first equation
        and solve for <m>C</m>. Once I know <m>C</m>, I can use the

        It's useful to go back to our harmonic system interpretation
        to understand these solutions. There are no oscillations in
        the homogeneous case here: sufficient friction gives
        exponential decay. However, there is oscillating forcing,
        though the forcing is also undering going exponential decay.
        This forcing is enough to add sinusoidal behaviour to the full
        solutions, but the decaying forcing terms means that the
        sinusoidal term will also decay over time. The amplitude of
        this combination of waves is given by the pythagorean
        combination: <m>\frac{\sqrt{13^2 + 8^2}}{233} =
        \frac{1}{\sqrt{233}}</m>.

        In this example, the forcing term is similar to one of the

        solution. Again, I've skipped more of the algebra in this
