        f(x) = 2 \sin x - \frac{1}{4} \sin (3x) + \frac{1}{5} \sin
        (7x) + \frac{1}{25} \sin (12 x) - \frac{1}{37} \sin (20x)

      After the heat equation, the next most accessible PDE is the
      wave equation. In one dimension, it again has a form
      <m>u(x,t)</m>. In this case, instead of describing heat, it
      describe the displacement of some wave in one-dimensional medium
      (think of a guitar string, perhaps) depending on position and
      time. Wave action is not diffusion: in this case, the concavity
      represents a displacement, which pulls on nearby points to cause
      an acceleration back to the equilibrium. This is a second
      derivative, so the wave equation has second derivatives in both
      space and time variables.
      <me>
        \frac{\del^2 u}{dt^2} = k \frac{\del^2 u}{del x^2}
      </me>
      Start the separation of variables as with the heat equation.
      Comment on what changes in the process. It is still possible to
      get to a point where Fourier series are useful. (You can assume
      the same boundary conditions: constant zero at both ends of the
      one dimensional object. Again, thinking of a guitar string, you
      can assume the ends of the string are fixed.)
