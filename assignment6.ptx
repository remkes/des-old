      Calcuulate the Fourier sine series for this function on the domain
      <m>(0, \pi)</m>.

        f(x) = 4 \delta_{\frac{\pi}{2}}(x) 
      </me>
      Given an interpretation of this as the initial conditions for
      the heat equation. Then write down and describe the solution
      of the heat equation using this initial condition. (8)

        f(x) = 2 \sin x - \frac{1}{4} \sin (3x) + \frac{1}{5} \sin
        (7x) + \frac{1}{25} \sin (12 x) - \frac{1}{37} \sin (20x)

      the heat equation. Then write down and describe the solution
      of the heat equation using this initial condition. (8)

    <li>
      Consider trying to solve the heat equation as describe in this
      course, but using the initial condition of <m>u(0,t) = 0</m> and
      <m>u(\pi,t) = 300e^{-\frac{1}{20}t}</m>. Go through the
      solution step and describe how this change affect the solution.
      How is the Fourier series and its calculation altered by this?
      (I don't want you actually complete solve the heat equation with
      these boundary condition -- just investigate enough to comment
      on how the process changes and what new challenges arise). (8)
