  <title>Functions</title>
  <p>
    This is a course about function, of course, since the solution of
    a differential equation is a function. This preliminary section is
    here to remind you of some definition and notations that will be
    useful in the course. First, there is some useful notation for
    sets of function on an interval. 
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be the <m>\RR</m> or an interval subset of <m>\RR</m>.
      </p>
      <p><ul>
        <li>
          <m>C(A)</m> is the set of continuous real-valued function on
          <m>A</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>C^1(A)</m> is the set of continuously differentiable
          functions on <m>A</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>C^n(A)</m> is the set of functions on <m>A</m> with
          <m>n</m> continuous derivatives.
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>C^\infty(A)</m> is the set of infinitly differentiable
          functions on <m>A</m>.
        </li>
      </ul></p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    I cannot always expect continuous solutions to differential
    equations. However, almost all of the solutions in this course
    will be at least piecewise-continuous. That definition is worth
    reviewing. 
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>\RR</m>.  A function <m>f:A
        \rightarrow \RR</m> is <term>piecewise-continuous</term> on
        <m>A</m> if it continous everywhere on <m>A</m> except for a
        set of isolated point.  Likewise, <m>f</m> is
        <term>piecewise-differentiable</term> on <m>A</m> if it
        differentiable everywhere on <m>A</m> except for a set of
        isolated points.  Note that <m>A</m> is the domain of the
        function: these piecewise functions can have jumps or break,
        but they are defined on all of <m>A</m>.  They cannot have,
        for example, asymptotes at these isolated points.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    There are many exponential functions in this course, since
    exponential functions solve many important differential equations.
    As in other calculus courses, I almost exclusively use the base
    <m>e</m> in this course, since it is the easiest base for
    derivatives and integrals.  Since any other base <m>a^t</m> can be
    written <m>a^t = e^{\ln a t}</m>, I will very frequently work with
    functions of the form <m>e^{\alpha t}</m> for some <m>\alpha \in
    \RR</m>. You can expect that typical exponential function to have
    this form.
