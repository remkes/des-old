  <title>Functions</title>
  <p>
    This is a course about function, of course, since the solution of
    a differential equation is a function. This preliminary section is
    here to remind you of some definition and notations that will be
    useful in the course. First, there is some useful notation for
    sets of function on an interval. 
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be the <m>\RR</m> or an interval subset of <m>\RR</m>.
      </p>
      <p><ul>
        <li>
          <m>C(A)</m> is the set of continuous real-valued function on
          <m>A</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>C^1(A)</m> is the set of continuously differentiable
          functions on <m>A</m>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>C^n(A)</m> is the set of functions on <m>A</m> with
          <m>n</m> continuous derivatives.
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>C^\infty(A)</m> is the set of infinitly differentiable
          functions on <m>A</m>.
        </li>
      </ul></p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    I cannot always expect continuous solutions to differential
    equations. However, almost all of the solutions in this course
    will be at least piecewise-continuous. That definition is worth
    reviewing. 
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>\RR</m>. A function <m>f:A
        \rightarrow \RR</m> is <term>piecewise-continuous</term> on
        <m>A</m> if it continous everywhere on <m>A</m> except for a
        set of isolated point. Likewise, <m>f</m> is
        <term>piecewise-differentiable</term> on <m>A</m> if it
        differentiable everywhere on <m>A</m> except for a set of
        isolated points. Note that <m>A</m> is the domain of the
        function: these piecewise functions can have jumps or break,
        but they are defined on all of <m>A</m>. They cannot have,
        for example, asymptotes at these isolated points.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    There are many exponential functions in this course, since
    exponential functions solve many important differential equations.
    As in other calculus courses, I almost exclusively use the base
    <m>e</m> in this course, since it is the easiest base for
    derivatives and integrals. Since any other base <m>a^t</m> can be
    written <m>a^t = e^{\ln a t}</m>, I will very frequently work with
    functions of the form <m>e^{\alpha t}</m> for some <m>\alpha \in
    \RR</m>. You can expect that typical exponential function to have
    this form. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="section-existence-and-uniqueness" />, it will be
    necessary to talk about functions of two variables. The study of
    those functions is covered in Calculus III, but since that course
    is not prerequisite to this material, I should say a little bit
    about such functions. A function <m>F(x,y)</m> of two variables is
    an expression in the two variables; alternatively, it is a model
    which depends on two different independent quantities. 
  <p>
  </p>
    Such function inherent many properties of ordinary function by
    treating each variable individually. That is, if I momentarily
    pretent that <m>y</m> is just some constant, I can think of
    <m>F(x,y)</m> as a single variable function of <m>x</m>; and
    vice-versa when I think of <m>x</m> momentarily as a constant. 
    This perspective gives the two properties that I will need in this
    course. 
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A function <m>F(x,y)</m> of two variables is
        <term>continuous</term> when it is continuous in each variable
        independently. Likewise, it is differentiable if is
        differentiable in each variable independently. Moreover, I can
        actually take derivatives this way. I can pretend that <m>y</m>
        is momentarily constant and differentiate in <m>x</m>; or vice
        versa when I pretend that <m>x</m> is momentarily constant and
        I differentiate in <m>y</m>. These derivatives are called
        <term>partial derivatives</term>. The notation for partial
        derivatives is an adjustment of the usual Leibniz notation.
