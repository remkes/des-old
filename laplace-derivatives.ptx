  <title>Laplace Transforms and Derivatives</title>
  <p>
    This is a course on differential equations; if Laplace transforms
    are useful, I will need them to relate to derivatives.  I will
    calculate what happens to a derivative of a function (of
    exponential order) in a Laplace transform.

      <mrow>
        \calL \left\{ \frac{df}{dt} \right\} \amp = \int_0^\infty
        \frac{df}{dt} e^{-st} dt
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        \amp = \left. fe^{-st} \right|_0^\infty - \int_0^\infty (-s)
        f(t) e^{-st} dt
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        \amp = \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty} f(a) e^{-sa} - f(0) + s
        \calL \{ f(t) \} (s) = -f(0) + s F(s)
      </mrow>
    </md>

    I can summarize the result in this rule.
    <me>
      \calL \{ f^\prime(t) \} (s) = -f(0) + sF(s)
    </me>.
    This is a lovely and convenient property. In the <m>s</m>-domain,
    there is no more differentiation. Differentiation is replaced by
    the much more approachable multiplication by the variable
    <m>s</m>, along with evaluation of the original function at zero.

    I can do a similar calculation for second derivatives. The
    calculation will involve two uses of integration by parts, though
    I can make use of the previous calculation to simplify the
    work.
    <md>
      <mrow>
        \calL \left\{ \frac{d^2f}{dt^2} \right\} \amp = \int_0^\infty
        \frac{d^2f}{dt^2} e^{-st} dt
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        \amp = \left. \frac{df}{dt} e^{-st} \right|_0^\infty +
        s\int_0^\infty \frac{df}{dt} e^{-st} dt
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        \amp = -f^\prime(0) - sf(0) + s^2 F(s)
      </mrow>
    </md>
  </p>

    Again, this is very convenient. The derivatives are completely
    removed in the <m>s</m>-domain, replaced with simple algebraic
    operations. The general result for any order of differentiation
    is this rule.
    <me>
      \calL \left\{ \frac{d^n f}{dt^n} \right\} = s^n F(s) - s^{n-1}
      f(0) - s^{n-2} f^\prime(0) - s^{n-3} f^{\prime \prime}(0) -
      \ldots - f^{(n-1)}(0)
    </me>
    The understanding of Laplace transforms of derivative leads to
    an amazing use of Laplace transforms in solving
    DEs. A Laplace transform changes differentiation into simple
    algebraic operations; therefore, it should change some DEs into
    algebraic equations. Since algebraic equations are much easier to
    solve than DEs, this is a huge advantage. However, I have one
    problem. If we want to solve a DE, I want to solve it in the
    <m>t</m>-domain. I can transform to the <m>s</m>-domain and
    solve the algebraic equation, but I need to get back to the
    <m>t</m>-domain to finish. For this, I need to invert the
    transform, which is covered in <xref
    ref="section-inverse-transforms" />. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Before I move on, here are two other properties of the Laplace
    transform which relate to derivatives. The first shows that
    integrals are also changed into something algebraic.
    <me>
      \calL \left\{ \int_0^t f(u) du \right\} = \frac{1}{s} \calL \{
      f(t) \}
    </me>
    The second is a parallel identity which shows how differentiation
    in the <m>s</m>-domain also comes from an algebraic operation on
    the <m>t</m>-domain.
    <me>
      \calL \{ t^n f(t) \} = (-1)^n \frac{d^n}{ds^n} \calL \{ f(t) \}
    </me>
