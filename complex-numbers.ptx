  <title>Complex Numbers</title>
  <p>
    I do not expect complex numbers to be familiar to you. I'm going
    to give a very brief description of them in this preliminary
    section. I will not use complex numbers often in this course, but
    they are key for a major result in <xref
    ref="chapter-second-order-odes" />.

    <statement>
      <p>
        The number <m>\imath</m> is defined by the property
        <m>\imath^2 = -1</m>. A <term>complex number</term> is any
        expression <m>a + b \imath</m> where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are
        real numbers. <m>a</m> is called the <term>real part</term>
        and <m>b</m> is called the <term>imaginary part</term>. The
        set of all complex number is written <m>\CC</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Addition and multiplication of complex numbers are extended from
    <m>\RR</m> by linearity and the distribution of multiplication.
    Note in the multiplication I use the defining property that
    <m>\imath^2 = -1</m>.

    All non-zero complex numbers are invertible (have a reciprocal).
    The reciprocal of a non-zero complex number is 
    <me>
      \frac{1}{a+ b \imath} = \frac{a-b\imath}{a^2+b^2}
    </me>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>conjugation</term> of a complex number
        <m>a+b\imath</m> is <m>a-b\imath</m>. It is indicated with a
        vertical bar <m>\overline{a+b\imath} = a-b\imath</m>.

    Complex numbers have many intriguing properties.
    The most important for this course is the guaranteed existence of
    roots of any polynomial.

  <theorem>
    <title>Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>p(x)</m> be a polynomial of degree <m>d</m> with real
        or complex coefficients. Then <m>p(x)</m> has exactly
        <m>d</m> roots in the complex numbers (though some may be
        repeated). Equivalently, <m>p(x)</m> factors completely over
        the complex numbers: there are complex numbers <m>\alpha_1,
        \ldots, \alpha_d</m>, not necessariliy distinct from each
        other, such that
        <me>
          p(x) = (x-\alpha_i)(x-\alpha_2)\ldots(x-\alpha_d)
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

    Complex exponentials are understood by Euler's formula. This is
    particularly important for us, since the complex numbers in this
    course will naturally appear in exponents.

  <proposition xml:id="prop-eulers-formula">
    <title>Euler's Formula</title>
    <statement>
      <me>
        e^{\imath \theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta
      </me>.
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      There are a variety of way to justify Euler's formlua. One of
      the justifications only needs the known taylor series for
      <m>e^x</m> and the trig functions, which were developed in
      Calculus II. In the following argument via talyor series, the
      number <m>\imath</m> can just be treated like any other
      constant. First I'll write the known taylor series for the three
      functions I need. Then I calculate <m>e^{\imath t}</m> via its
      taylor series. Various manipulations of the series, using
      linearity and splitting up the series into even and odd terms,
      leads to the final expression in the taylor series for sine and
      cosine, proving Euler's formula.
