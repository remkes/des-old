  <title>What is a Differential Equation?</title>

    <title>First Definitions</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>differential equation</term> is any equation
          involving a function <m>f(t)</m> and its derivatives
          <m>f^\prime(t)</m>, <m>f^{\prime \prime}(t)</m>, etc. The
          highest derivative in the equation is called the
          <term>order</term> of the equation. A DE which involves
          partial derivatives is called a <term>partial differential
          equation</term>; otherwise, it is called an <term>ordinary
          differtial equation</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      More holistically, a differential equation asks the question:
      what function satisfies a given relationship?  In algebra, this
      is a familiar question for numbers. <m>t + 5 = 7</m> implicitly
      asks which number, when replacing <m>t</m>, satisfies the
      equation. The answer, of course, is <m>t=2</m>; the solution to
      the equation gives the correct replacement. For differential
      equations, I ask <sq>what function</sq> instead of <sq>what
      number</sq>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many ways to write a differential equation. The most
      general way is to think of any algebraic combination of a
      function <m>y</m>, its derivatives and the independent variable
      <m>t</m>. In this generality, I could write the equation using
      a multivariable function <m>F</m>.
      <me>
        F(t,y, y^\prime, \ldots, y^{(n)}) = 0
      </me>
      Often, if I can, I isolate the highest derivative.
      <me>
        y^{(n)} = F(t,y,y^\prime, \ldots, y^{(n-1)})
      </me>
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A differential equation is called <term>autonomous</term> is
          the independent variable doesn't appear. For a first order
          equation, this looks like
          <me>
            \frac{dy}{dt} = f(y)
          </me> for some expression <m>f(y)</m> in the dependent
          variable. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An equation is called <term>linear</term> if it has the form
          <me>
            a_n(t)y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}(t)y^{(n-1)} + \ldots + a_1(t)
            y^\prime + a_0(t) y = f(t)
          </me>.
          In addition, a linear equation is called
          <term>homogenous</term> if the <m>f(t)</m> term is simply
          <m>f(t) = 0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      A very useful notational tool for linear DEs is the idea of a
      linear differential operator.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="definition-linear-differential-operator">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>differentiable operator</term> is an operator which
          acts on functions either by multplication by fixed functions
          or by differentiation. The operator is <term>linear</term>
          if the various pieces of the operation are added together.
          Fore example, a second order linear equation has this form
          <me>
            L = a(t) \frac{d^2}{dt^2} + b(t) \frac{d}{dt} + c
          </me>
          (it is second order since the highest derivative is a second
          derivative). 
        </p>
        <p>
          I can use differentiable operators to simplify notations for
          DE. Using the operator <m>L</m> I just defined, a second
          order linear DE become simply <m>Ly = f(t)</m>.

        <p>
          The simplest differential equation is
          <me>
            \frac{df}{dt} = \alpha f(t)
          </me>.
          For many differential equations, I seek a translation of
          their meaning. The translation of this simple equation is
          that the rate of change is propotional to the current value.
          This is a statement of percentage growth; the
          proportionality constant is the percentage.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      The solutions to this equation are are <m>f(t) = ce^{\alpha
      t}</m>. Notice that there is a constant, <m>c</m>, such that
      there will be a whole infinite family of solutions. A specific
      solution is specified by a choice of <m>c</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percentage growth applies to population models. If a population
      is describe by the solution <m>f(t) = ce^{\alpha t}</m> then
      <m>f(0) = ce^0 = c</m> and I must interpret the constant
      <m>c</m> as the population when <m>t=0</m>. This is the
      starting popluation, so I call <m>c</m> the <em>initial
      value</em> of the solution. A full solution of a differential
      equation will usually consist of a function and choice(s) for
      the initial value(s). 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A differential equation along with a specified initial value
          is called an <term>initial value problem</term> or IVP.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      If I don't make a choice, as I said, I get an infinite family of
      solutions. I can visualize this family as a series of graphs in
      <m>\RR^2</m>. <xref ref="figure-family-of-solutions" /> shows
      the graphs for <m>f(t) = ce^{\alpha t}</m>.

    <title>Pure and Applied Perspectives</title>
    <p>
      I will be looking at differential equations both from a pure
      mathematics and applied mathematics point of view. The pure
      mathematician is interested in the following kinds of
      questions.
    </p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>
        When does a solution exists?
      </li>
      <li>
        Can I prove that a solution exists?
      </li>
      <li>
        Is the solution unique?
      </li>
      <li>
        Is there a complete family? How many parameters exist, and
        what are their domains?
      </li>
      <li>
        Can I write and prove theorems to answer these questions?
      </li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>
      In contrast, the applied mathematician is interested in the
      following kinds of questions.
    </p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>
        How many solutions fit the data or initial values?
      </li>
      <li>
        How do the solutions grow? What is their behaviour?
      </li>
      <li>
        Are the solutiosnts stable?
      </li>
      <li>
        How difficult are the solutions to calculate?  Can I calculate
        them exacly, or only approximately?
      </li>
      <li>
        Can I answer questions about the model even without a solution?
      </li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>
      A robust study of differential equations involves both
      perspectives. The pure perspective gives you background, context
      and rigour. The theorems it produces are necessary to the
      efficient use of DEs in applied mathematics. The applied
      perspective, most often, gives the motivated and selects the
      important problems. It also stresses the value of qualitative
      methods and their interpretation.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsection-interesting-examples">
    <title>Interesting Examples</title>
    <p>
      I want to understand the behaviour of solutions of DEs. The
      examples in this section give some typical behaviours and
      archetypes, ideas that will be repeated over and over again in
      the course. For these examples, I'm simply going to give you the
      DE and its solution <emdash /> no solution methods here. The
      point is to show the kinds of behaviours that often occur. 
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <me>
            \frac{d^2f}{dt^2} + 9 f = 0
          </me>
          This is solved by <m>\sin 3t</m> and also by <m>\cos 3t</m>.
          Moreover, any linear combination <m>a\sin 3t + b \cos 3t</m>
          is a solution. In a second order equation, I expect two
          linearly independent solutions and the general solution is a
          linear combination of the two linearly independent
          solutions. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <me>
            \frac{dy}{dt} = t \sqrt{y}
          </me>
          This is solved by <m>y = (\frac{t^2}{4} + c)^2</m>, which is
          a nice family with one real parameter. However, this is
          also solved by <m>y=0</m>, even though it isn't in the
          family. It's important to be aware that this situation can
          occur. There is even a name for such a solution.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An extraneous solutions to a DE, one which falls outside
          families with parameters, is called <term>singular
          solution</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <me>
            t \frac{dy}{dt} = 4y
          </me>
          This is solved by <m>y = ct^4</m>, which is another
          reasonable family. However, there is a strange, singular
          solution.
          <me>
            y(t) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} 
              -t^4 \amp t \leq 0 \\ 
              t^4 \amp t>0 
            \end{matrix} \right.
          </me>
          The derivatives of this function line up at the origin, so
          the function is of class <m>C^1</m> (actually <m>C^3</m>, if
          you work it out).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>

          </me>
          The curve <m>x^2 + y^2 = c</m> solves this equation
          implicitly. I could break this up into two functions, but
          its much more natural to leave it as an implicit locus, in
          this case, a circle. This is very typical: often solutions
          are left in an implicit form as loci, even though in theory
          I always look for solutions which are functions <m>y =
          f(x)</m>. Also notice in this example that only
          non-negative <m>c</m> values are allowed in this family of
          solutions. There is no guarantee that all values of a
          parameter will lead to reasonable solutions.

    <title>The Pessimistic Outlook</title>
    <p>
      In some sense, a DE is an mathematical application of a
      scientific method. Often an observation about a phenomenon can
      be expressed as a relationship between a function and its
      derivative, such as the observation of percentage growth. The
      DE, then, is the hypothesis born of observation. If wI can find
      the solution, it gives me a predictive model of the phenomenon,
      which I can test. If the solution matches the observed
      behaviour, I conclude the DE model is relatively reliable; if
      the solution diverges from the observed behaviour, we discard or
      amend the DE.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way, DEs allow the modelling many phenomena:
      popluations, radioactive decay, cooling, disease, metabolish,
      newtonian motion with friction, chemical reactions, gravity,
      predaor-prey models, hamiltonian mechanics, quantum mechanics,
      interest, bacterial growth, neuron firing, ecology, mixtures,
      draining, series circuits, suspended cables, and many, many
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, for all this power and utility, DEs are terribly
      difficult to solve. The sad truth is that mathematicians can
      exactly solve only a very small portion of them. Due to this
      limitation, many techniques are developed to understand
      approximate solutions or infer information about solutions
      indirectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, many DEs have solutions which are entirely new
      functions.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <me>
            \frac{dy}{dt} = e^{-t^2} \implies y = \int e^{-t^2}dt + C
          </me>
          This integrand is a <m>C^\infty</m> function, so the
          anti-derivative exists, but there is no name for it in the
          elementary functions. This is not uncommon. Often I will
          <sq>solve</sq> a differential equation by simply naming the
          solution with a new name, since it is an entirely new
          function.
