            You should have found real roots to the quadratic equation

            First I write and solve the characteristic equation.
            <me>
              r^2 + 8r + 4 = 0  \implies r = -4 \pm \sqrt{12} 
            </me>
            The root are real and distinct. Therefore, the
            homogeneous solutions are exponential.
            <me>
              y = A e^{(-4+\sqrt{12})t} + Be^{(-4-\sqrt{12})t} 
            </me>
            I also need the derivatives of the homogeneous solution.
            <me>
              y^\prime = (-4+\sqrt{12}) A e^{(-4+\sqrt{12})t} +
              (-4-\sqrt{12}) B e^{(-4-\sqrt{12})t} 
            </me>
            Then I use the initial conditions. 
            <md>
              <mrow>
                y(0) = A + B = 10 
              </mrow>
                <mrow>
                y^\prime(0) = (-4\sqrt{12}) A + (-4-\sqrt{12}) B = -4
              </mrow>
            </md>
            I can do the algebra to solve the system. I use the first
            equation to replace <m>A</m> with <m>10-B</m>. Then I
            manipulate to solve for <m>B</m> and finally use the first
            equation again to calculate <m>A</m>.
            <md>
              <mrow>
                -4 \amp = (-4+\sqrt{12}) (10-B) + (-4-\sqrt{12}) B 
              </mrow>
              <mrow>
                -4 \amp = (-40+10\sqrt{12}) + (4-\sqrt{12})B  +
                (-4-\sqrt{12}) B 
              </mrow>
              <mrow>
                36 - 10 \sqrt{12} \amp = -2\sqrt{12})B  
              </mrow>
              <mrow>
                \frac{36 - 10 \sqrt{12}}{-2\sqrt{12}} \amp = B 
              </mrow>
              <mrow>
                \frac{5 \sqrt{12}-18}{\sqrt{12}} \amp = B 
              </mrow>
              <mrow>
                A \amp = 10 - B = \frac{18 + 5 \sqrt{12}}{\sqrt{12}} 
              </mrow>
            </md>
            Therefore, the specific solution is 
            <me>
              y = \frac{18 + 5\sqrt{12}}{\sqrt{12}}
              e^{(-4+\sqrt{12})t} + \frac{5 \sqrt{12} - 18}{\sqrt{12}}
              e^{(-4-\sqrt{12})t} 
            </me>
          </li>
          <li>
            When we make the coefficient of <m>y^\prime</m> smaller,
            it decreases the magnitude of the positive term <m>\sqrt{b^2 -
            4ac}</m> in the quadratic equation. Therefore, the roots
            become closer and closer together. For small changes in
            this coefficient, the roots remain real and the solutions
            remain exponentia. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Critically damped happens when the solution to the
            characteristic equation is a repeated root. This happens
            exactly when <m>b^2-4ac = 0</m>. In this equation, <m>4ac
            = 16</m>, so the coefficient of <m>y^\prime</m> must shink
            to <m>4</m> to get this behaviour. 
          </li>
          <li>
            To get oscillations, you need to keep decreasing the
            coefficient bast the critically damped point. With the
            logical of the previous point, oscillations will start
            when the coefficient is decreased below <m>4</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a harmonic system, you are changing the friction term.
            By lowering the friction, you allow for more movement and
            eventually for oscillations. in a circuit, you are
            lowering the resistance, which is similar to friction in
            that it removes energy from the system.

            You should have found complex roots to the quadratic equation
            above, giving sinusoidal soltuions. Now take the

      <solution>

            First I write and solve the characteristic equation.
            <me>
              r^2 + 4r + 20 = 0 \implies r = -2 \pm \sqrt{-4}
            </me>
            The root are complex with a negative real part. <m>\alpha
            = -2</m> and <m>\beta = 4</m>.  Therefore, the homogeneous
            solutions are sinusoidal with exponentially decay in
            amplitude.
            <me>
              y = A e^{-2t} \cos 4t + B e^{-2t} \sin 4t 
            </me>
            I also need the derivatives of the homogeneous solution.
            (I've grouped like terms after taking the derivative).
            <me>
              y^\prime = (-2A + 4B) e^{-2t} \cos 4t + (-4A -2B)
              e^{-2t} \sin 4t
            </me>
            Then I use the initial conditions. 
            <md>
              <mrow>
                y(0) \amp = A = 2 
              </mrow>
              <mrow>
                y^\prime(0) \amp = (-2A + 4B) = 6 -4 + 4B = 6 \implies B =
                \frac{10}{4} = \frac{5}{2} 
              </mrow>
            </md>
            The solutions to the resulting system doesn't require much
            work, sinc ethe first initial condition gives <m>A</m>
            directly and I used the second to calculate <m>B</m>.
            The specific solution is 
            <me>
              y = 2 e^{-2t} \cos 4t + \frac{5}{2} e^{-2t} \sin 4t 
            </me>
          </li>
            As you decrease the coefficient, <m>\alpha</m> remains
            unchanged since it only depends on the other two
            coefficients. Therefore, the rate of decay is unchanged.
            However, <m>\beta = \frac{\sqrt{4ac - b^2}}{2a}</m> does
            depend on the coefficient of <m>y</m>, which is <m>c</m>
            in the quadratic formula. As that coefficient becomes
            smaller and smaller, <m>\beta</m> also decreases. Since
            <m>\beta</m> measures frequency, decreasing <m>beta</m>
            means slower oscillations. 
          <li>
            Critically damped oscillations happen when <m>\beta =
            0</m>, or equivalently when <m>b^2 - 4ac=0</m>. In this
            system, since <m>b=4</m> and <m>a = 1</m>, the coefficient
            of <m>y</m> has to be <m>c=4</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Exponential decay will happen below the <m>c=4</m>
            threshold, when <m>b^2 -4ac</m> is positive again and the
            solutions will be real exponentials. 
          </li>
          <li>
            In a harmonic system, you are changing the stiffness of
            the system.  Decreasing the stiffness makes the system
            less responsive and less likely to have oscilations. For
            circuits, you are effect the.  capacitance, which is (in
            some ways) analogous to stiffness in the circuit system.

          Now that I now the coefficients, I can write the particular

          I need the derivative of the general solution. (The algebra
          is a bit lengthy, but I've done the derivatives and then
          groups like terms to make the derivative as easy to work

          Then I use the initial conditions. I get two equations, which
          I can turn into a linear system. The first equation,

            r^2 + 4r + 8 = 0 \implies r = -2 \pm \sqrt{-4}

          The roots are complex with <m>\alpha = -2</m> and <m>\beta =
          2</m>.  Therefore, the homogeneous solutions are sinusoidal

          My guess for the particular solution using undetermined
          coefficients some from the forcing term. Note that even
          those the forcing term and the homogeneous solution both
          involve the same sine funciton, I don't have to multiply by
          <m>t</m> in my guess because the forcing term lacks the
          exponential decay of the homogeneous solution.

          This produces a system of linear equations. I haven't shown
          the work for solving the system, though this is a pretty

          I need the derivative of the general solution. (I've skipped

          Then I use the initial conditions. I get two equations, which

          Solve this SOCCLDE using variation of parameters. (You can
          leave the resulting integrals if they are unsolvable.)

            y^{\prime \prime} + 10y^\prime + 5y = \arctan t

      <solution>
        <p>
          First I need to solve the homogeneous equation. I write and
          solve the characteristic equation.
          <me>
            r^2 + 10r + 5 = 0 \implies r = -5 \pm \sqrt{20}
          </me>
          The roots are complex with <m>\alpha = -5</m> and <m>\beta =
          \sqrt{20}</m> Therefore, the homogeneous solutions are
          sinusoidal with exponential decay.

            y_h = A e^{-5t} \cos (\sqrt{20} t) + B e^{-5t} \sin
            (\sqrt{20} t ) 
          </me>
          Then I need to calculate the Wronskian. For this I need the
          derivatives of the two linearly independent homogeneous
          solutions.

          These integrals are not solvable, so I just write the
