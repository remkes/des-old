      With algebraic equation, a <term>system of equations</term> is a
      set of equation (usually more than one, but technically one
      equation can still be a sort-of boring system). To solve a
      system of algebraic equations is to try to find values of the
      variable(s) that satisfy all the equation. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        A <term>system of differential equations</term> is defined in
        exactly the same way: it is a set of differential equations
        about the same function or functions. A solution is a set of
        functions which satisfy all of the differential equations
        simultaneously. 
      </statement>

      Many of the definition from <xref ref="section-what-is-a-de" />
      can be directly extended to systems.

            The <term>order</term> of a system of differential

            equation.

            A system of differential equations is a <term>linear

            A linear system of differential equation is

      Solutions to systems of differential equation typically come in
      familiar, due to constants of integration. To determine a
      specific solution requires initial conditions. If there are
      multiple functions involved, I may need to specify initial
      conditions for each of the functions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The difference between linear systems and non-linear systems is
      immensely important. I'll demonstrate some exactly solutions for
      linear system (with constant coefficients) in <xref
      ref="section-linear-systems" />. However, the key examples to
      follow will be entirely non-linear. One might wonder why it is
      still useful to study linear systems after the motivating
      examples show such linearity. There are, in fact, strong reasons
      to still understand linear systems. Often, the linear
      approximation to a non-linear system can demonstrate many of the
      dynamics of the system. This approximation also is an important
      first step to understanding the non-linear, introducing the
      complication as an adjustment to the linear approximation.

    <title>Key Examples</title>
    <p>
      There are a number of important motiavting examples. I first
      look to biology, where the interaction of species produces
      systems of linear equations. The Lokta-Volterra equations model
      predator-prey relationships. Let <m>p(t)</m> be the population
      of prey and <m>q(t)</m> be the population of predators. These
      equations describe the interactions between the two
      derivatives.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \frac{dp}{dt} \amp = ap - bpq
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \frac{dq}{dt} \amp = cpq - dq
        </mrow>
      </md>
      The coefficients <m>a,b,c</m> and <m>d</m> are all positive
      coefficients. <m>a</m> is a natural birth rate for the prey,
      <m>b</m> is the death of prey due to predation, <m>c</m> is the
      growth rate of predators due to predation, and <m>d</m> is the
      natural death rate of predators. The product <m>pq</m>
      represents the number of interactions between predators and
      prey. The Lokta-Volterra system is a classic system in
      mathematical biology; however, its non-linearity makes it
      difficult to solve and the solutions are not expressible by
      elementary functions. To help understanding the system without
      having to actually calculate difficult solutions, I will
      introduce qualitative methods of analysis in <xref
      ref="section-systems-qualitative-methods" />.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathematical biology has many systems similar to Lokta-Volterra.
      If <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are two species competing for the same
      resources, there is a very similar two-equation DE model.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \frac{dp}{dt} \amp = a_pp\left(1- \frac{p + b_p q}{c_p} \right)
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \frac{dq}{dt} \amp = a_qp\left(1- \frac{q + b_q p}{c_q} \right)
        </mrow>
      </md>
      The coefficients <m>a_p</m> and <m>a_q</m> are the natural
      growth rates of each species, <m>c_p</m> and <m>c_q</m> are the
      carrying capacities of the environment for each species, and
      <m>b_p</m> and <m>b_q</m> measure the effects of competition.
      Like the Lokta-Voltera equations, this is a difficult non-linear
      system where I should not expect elementary function solutions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Infection disease models are also systems of differential
      equations. The SIR model is a good example. In a population
      exposed to an infection disease, let <m>S</m> be the susceptible
      population, <m>I</m> the infected population, and <m>R</m> the
      recovered population. The model is this system of three
      differential equations.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \frac{dS}{dt} \amp = -a I S
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \frac{dI}{dt} \amp = a I S - b I
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \frac{dR}{dt} \amp = b I
        </mrow>
      </md>
      Here <m>a</m> measures the increase in infection due to
      interactions between the infected and susceptible population and
      <m>b</m> measures the natural recovery of the infected
      population. Many similar models exist to model infection
      disease.

      Mathematical biology only gets more complex and involved from
      here. The following link shows the system of DEs in the 2004
      Molecular Biology of the Cell Paper 
      <url
      href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC491841/table/tbl1/">
      <q>Integrative Analysis of
      Cell Cycle Control in Budding Yeast</q> by K.C. Chen et.
      al.</url> This table is already pretty complicated, with many
      linear differential equation. In systems biology, this is only
      the start. A more complete model of cellular reactions can
      involve hundreds or thousands of coupled differential equations.
      These models are almost exclusively linear, simply because
      systems of this size aren't at all approachable if they are not
      linear. The actualy cellular interactions are most likely
      non-linear, and these models, as complex as they are, remain at
      best linear approximations of even more complicated situations.

      Examples exist in other disciplines as well. Back in the world
      of physics, I can look at the physics of the coupled spring. In
      this sytem, there is a mass <m>m_1</m> on a spring with spring
      constant <m>k_1</m> attached to a fixed object. Then there is a 
      second mass <m>m_2</m> attached to the first by a spring wih
      spring constant <m>k_2</m>. Analyzing the forces and using
      Newton's law of motion results in a system of DEs.
