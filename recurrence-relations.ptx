  <title>Recurrence Relations</title>
  <p>
    Recurrence relations may be review or may be a new definition for
    you. Let me give the definition.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A sequence <m>\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty</m> of real numbers is
        called a <term>linear recurrence relation</term> if each term
        <m>a_n</m> is a linear function of the previous <m>k</m> terms
        <m>a_{n-1}, \ldots a_{n-k}</m>. <m>k</m> is called the
        <em>order</em> of the recurrence relation. Since terms
        depends on previous terms, the first <m>k</m> terms of the
        sequence must be explicitly defined.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    The most famous example is the Fibonacci sequence, which is a
    second order linear recurrence relation. Its terms, <m>f_n</m>,
    start with <m>f_1 = f_2 = 1</m> and then obey the linear
    recurrence <m>f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If I am given a recurrence relation relation, I don't have a
    direct way to calculate the term <m>a_n</m> without calculating
    all the previous terms. <term>Solving a recurrence relation</term> 
    means finding a fixed formula <m>a_n = f(n)</m> that
    describes the <m>n</m>th term of the sequence. These can be easy
    or difficult to find. The fixed formula for Fibonnaci is
    <me>
      f_n = \frac{(1+\sqrt{5})^n - (1-\sqrt{5})^n}{2^n \sqrt{5}}
    </me>.
    The coefficients of a taylor series are sequences of real numbers.
    In the use of taylor series in this course, sequences of
    coefficients will be presented as recurrence relations. I will
    want to solve the recurrence relations to give a closed formula
    for the coefficients, in order to understand the resulting taylor
    series. Though there is a whole mathematical theory of recurrence
    relation, in this course I will solve them mostly by inspection
    <mdash />by looking at the terms and trying to determine a pattern
    directly. I won't rely on other techniques which are likely
    unfamiliar to you.
