  <title>Inverse Laplace Transforms</title>
  <p>
    We would like an operation <m>\calL^{-1}</m> which undoes the
    Laplace transform.
    <me>
      \calL^{-1} \left\{ \calL \{ f(t) \} \right\} = f(t)
    </me>
    This is very difficult to calculate directly, and the construction
    of the inverse transform is beyond the scope of this course. (It
    relies on complex ananlysis.) I'll state the result for
    completeness.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\alpha</m> be a real number which is larger than all
        real singularities of <m>F(s)</m>. Let <m>\gamma</m> be a
        path in <m>\CC</m> which goes in a straight line from
        <m>\alpha - \imath T</m> to <m>\alpha + \imath T</m>.
        <me>
          \calL^{-1} (F(s)\} = \frac{1}{2\pi \imath} \lim_{T
          \rightarrow \infty} \int_{\gamma} e^{st} F(s) ds
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    Note this is a contour integral in <m>\CC</m>, a common object in
    the study of complex variables. The use of the distance to
    singularities makes sense in that discipline, since contour
    integrals depend on the location of singularities. For those with
    a background in complex variable, note that this is not a closed
    curve and the homotopy implications depend a great deal on the
    function <m>F</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For our purposes, we'll just use tables to find inverse Laplace
    transforms, using the functions we already know. We'll try to
    turn the <m>s</m> domain answers into familiar forms and invert
    known functions. This is a bit tricky, but can often be done.
    The use of shifts will be particularly inportant. We should note
    that <m>\calL^{-1}</m> is also linear.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can make a table of the most important inverse transforms.

    The shift in an inverse transform is captured by the rule
    <me>
      \calL^{-1} \left\{ e^{-sa} F(s) \right\} = u_a(t) f(t-a)
    </me>.
    This shifts of trigonometric functions are common enough that it
    is useful to mention them here.
