  <title>Inverse Laplace Transforms</title>
  <p>
    I would like to define an operation <m>\calL^{-1}</m> which undoes
    the Laplace transform.
    <me>
      \calL^{-1} \left\{ \calL \{ f(t) \} \right\} = f(t)
    </me>
    This is very difficult to calculate directly, and the construction
    of the inverse transform is beyond the scope of this course. (It
    relies on complex ananlysis.) I'll state the result for your
    interest, but it's not a result I'm going to work with at all.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\alpha</m> be a real number which is larger than all
        real singularities of <m>F(s)</m>. Let <m>\gamma</m> be a
        path in <m>\CC</m> which goes in a straight line from
        <m>\alpha - \imath T</m> to <m>\alpha + \imath T</m>. Then the
        inverse Laplace transform is defined by the following limit
        and integral. 
        <me>
          \calL^{-1} (F(s)\} = \frac{1}{2\pi \imath} \lim_{T
          \rightarrow \infty} \int_{\gamma} e^{st} F(s) ds
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    This is a contour integral in <m>\CC</m>, a common object in
    the study of complex variables. The use of the distance to
    singularities makes sense in that discipline, since contour
    integrals depend on the location of singularities. For those with
    a background in complex variables, this is not a closed
    curve and the homotopy implications depend a great deal on the
    function <m>F</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For our purposes, I'll just use tables to find inverse Laplace
    transforms, using the functions we already know. I'll try to
    turn the <m>s</m> domain answers into familiar forms and invert
    known functions. This is a bit tricky, but can often be done.
    The use of shifts will be particularly inportant. I should note
    that <m>\calL^{-1}</m> is also linear.

    Here is a table of the most important inverse transforms.

        \calL^{-1} \left\{ \frac{1}{s-a} \right\} \amp = e^{at}

        \calL^{-1} \left\{ \frac{s}{s^2 -k^2} \right\} \amp = \cosh

        \calL^{-1} \left\{ e^{-sa} \right\} \amp = \delta_a(t)

    The shift in an inverse transform is captured by the rule
    <me>
      \calL^{-1} \left\{ e^{-sa} F(s) \right\} = u_a(t) f(t-a)
    </me>.
    This shifts of trigonometric functions are common enough that it
    is useful to mention them here.
    <md>
      <mrow>
        \calL^{-1} \left\{ \frac{\beta}{(s+ \alpha)^2 + \beta^2}
        \right\} \amp = e^{-\alpha t} \sin \beta t
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        \calL^{-1} \left\{ \frac{s + \alpha}{(s+ \alpha)^2 + \beta^2}
        \right\} \amp = e^{-\alpha t} \cos \beta t
      </mrow>
    </md>
    Finally, the last rule from <xref
    ref="section-laplace-derivatives" /> is useful for dealing with
    <m>s</m>-domain functions which I can identity as derivatives of
    functions previous listed in the tables. Inverting that rule
    gives the following rule for inverse transforms.
    <me>
      \calL^{-1} \left\{ \frac{d^n}{ds^n} F(s) \right\} = (-1)^n t^n
      f(t) 
    </me>
