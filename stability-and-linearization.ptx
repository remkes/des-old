    <title>Stability</title>
    <p>
      <xref ref="section-qualitative-methods" /> introduced the indea
      of analyzing a differential equation qualitatively, often
      without actually knowing the solution. In qualitative analysis,
      the goal is often describing a reasonable narrative for the
      solution. A big part of that narrative can be described in the
      language of <term>stability</term>. In this section, I want to
      introduce the concept of stability and how it is used to
      describe solutions to differential equations.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll start with an autonomous first order equation. 
      <me>
        \frac{dp}{dt} = f(p)
      </me>
      For these autonomous equation, stability is a properties of the
      steady states. Recall that the steady states are the values of
      the population where the rate of change is zero; the population
      at a steady state doesn't move. Stability asks: what happens
      when the initial value of the system is very close to the steady
      state? 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The steady states of an autonomous DE are classified by
          their <term>stability</term>.
        </p>
        <p><ul>
          <li>
            A steady state <m>P</m> is <term>stable</term> if <m>p(t)
            \rightarrow P</m> for any initial value close to <m>P</m>.
            Stable steady states are also called
            <term>attractors</term>. In the phase line diagram,
            trajectories points toward stable steady states.
          </li>
          <li>
            A steady state is <term>partially stable</term> if <m>p(t)
            \rightarrow P</m> for some initial values close to
            <m>P</m>, but <m>p(t)</m> diverges away from <m>P</m> for
            other initial values close to <m>P</m>. I can also be a
            bit more specific here. The state is called <term>stable or
            attractive from above</term> if <m>p(t)
            \rightarrow P</m> for initial values slighlty larger than
            <m>P</m>; likewise, the state is called <term>stable or
            attractive from below</term> is <m>p(t) \rightarrow P</m>
            for initial values slightly smaller than <m>P</m>. On the
            phase line, a partially stable state has one trajectory
            pointing towards the steady state and one pointing away. 
          </li>
          <li>
            If both trajectories point away, the steady state is
            called <term>unstable</term>. Unstable steady states are
            also called <term>repellors</term>.
          </li>
        </ul></p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      I've given the definition of stability for first order
      autonomous DEs. However, the concept of stability has much
      broader applications to a variety of differential equations (and
      particularly to systems of differential equations). I am not
      going to give a formal definition, but the general idea is the
      same. More complicated DEs and systems of DEs can also have
      steady states. They are stable, or attractors, if nearby initial
      values tend towards the steady steady state. They are unstable,
      or repellors, if neary initial values tend away from the steady
      states. In more complicated systems, all kinds of intermediate
      or partially stable behaviours are also possible. <xref
      ref="chapter-systems" /> will investigate some of the
      interesting intermediate behaviours for systems of two linear
      DEs.

    <title>Linearization</title>
    <p>
      Once I have identified a steady state of a DE system, my
      interest is often limited to the behaviour of initial values
      close to the steady state. This is the behaviour that stability
      capture: whether the system approachs or diverges from the
      steady state when its start a small distance away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me take the same setup of an autonomous equation
      <me>
        \frac{dp}{dt} = f(p)
      </me>
      with steady state <m>P</m>. I'll assume that <m>f(p)</m> is an
      analytic function. I can define a new function <m>q(t) =
      p(t) - P</m>. I am essentially moving the steady state to zero
      with this new function. I can change the differential equation
      to reflect this new function <m>q(t)</m>. The derivative is the
      same: <m>\frac{dq}{dt} = \frac{dp}{dt}</m>, since the only
      difference is the subtraction of a constant. On the left, I can
      replace <m>p</m> by <m>P+q</m>. That gives a new autonomous
      differential equation.
      <me>
        \frac{dq}{dt} = f(P + q)
      </me>
      As desired, <m>q=0</m> is now the steady state of this new DE.
      Now I'm going to expand the function <m>f</m> as a taylor series
      centered at <m>P</m>. (Why would I want to expand <m>f</m> as a
      taylor series? Well, because it accomplishes the goal of this
      section, as you will see.) This is a bit strange and subtle: the
      variable for this taylor series is <m>q</m>, not <m>t</m>. Here
      is the result, just showing the first two terms of the taylor
      series. 
      <me>
        \frac{dq}{dt} = f(P + q) = f(P) + f^\prime(P) (P + q - P) +
        \ldots 
      </me>
      Now <m>f(P) = 0</m> since <m>P</m> was, by definition, a steady
      state of the original autonomous DE. In the second term, the
      <m>P</m> cancels off. Let me make those adjustments. 
      <me>
        \frac{dq}{dt} = f(P + q) = f(P) + f^\prime(P) (P + q - P) +
        \ldots = f^\prime(P) q + \ldots
      </me>
      Now I want to take an approximation to the differential equation
      by ignoring everything past the first taylor series term. This
      is a severe approximaiton, but it is still quite useful. Here is
      the new approximated DE. 
      <me>
        \frac{dq}{dt} \cong f^\prime(P) q 
      </me>
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>linearization</term> of an autonomous DE at the
          steady state <m>P</m> is the related differential equation
          produced by taking only the first term of the taylor series
          of the right side. 
          <me>
            \frac{dq}{dt} = f^\prime(P) q
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The solution to the linearized DE is always an exponential
      function, since the approximate DE always has the form of the
      standard percentage growth differential equation. 
      <me>
        q(t) = q_0 e^{f^\prime(P) t}
      </me>
      Indeed, I can think of the linearization as the best
      approximation to the solution by an exponential function. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Since it is an exponential function, this linearized solution is
      either exponential growth or decay, depending on the sign of
      <m>f^\prime(P)</m>. Therefore, the sign of <m>f^\prime(P)</m>
      determines the stability: positive and the solution is unstabe,
      since exponential growth takes the solution away from the steady
      state; negative and the solution is stable, since exponential
      decay takes the solution towards the steady state. This can also
      be seen in the phase line, since the sign of the derivative can
      indicate the trajectories on either side of the steady state. If
      <m>f^\prime(P) = 0</m>, then the stability is determined by the
      higher order terms of the taylor series expansion and the
      linearization of the differential equation is inconclusive. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For now, there isn't much more I will do with this
      linearization. However, it is worth introducing here as a theme
      since it is so central to applied mathematics. Linear equations
      are almost always the first kind of DE that applied
      mathematicians try to use, typically since they have elegant and
      accessible solutions. Everything else gets simply referred to a
      <sq>non-linear</sq>; in many ways, <sq>non-linear</sq> is a
      synonmy for annoying and complicated. However, linear models
      only go so far and often the non-linearity holds the key to
      understanding a model. Even so, I often want to understand the
      linear part first and then figure out how to add in the
      non-linearity in a reasonable fashion to add subtlety to a
      model.
