    <p>
      The discussion <xref ref="section-undetermined-coefficients" />
      about the similarity between forcing terms and the homogeneous
      solutions leads into the subject of resonance in harmonic
      sequences. The question of resonance is this: is there a
      particular frequency for an external force on a harmonic system
      which produces the strongest effect? 
    </p>
    <p>
      This is an important question in a number of situations. In
      audio design and acoustics, an engineer may want to design
      explicitly for resonance. In the safety of structures, an
      engineer would like to ensure that resonant behaviour is
      impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll start with the SOCCLDE describing an underdamped harmonic
      system. (Underdamped is necessary to allow for the possibility
      of resonance, as the calculations will show). Recall that
      for harmonic systems, the coefficients can be identified as mass
      <m>m</m>, spring constant <m>k</m>, coefficient of friction
      <m>b</m> and forcing <m>f(t)</m>.
      <me>
        m y^{\prime \prime} + b y^{\prime} + ky = f(t)
      </me>
      Look at the characterstic equation <m>mr^2 + br + k=0</m>. It
      has solutions
      <me>
        r = \frac{-b}{2m} \pm \frac{\sqrt{b^2-4km}}{2m}
      </me>.
      I can define a new constant, called the damping constant, to
      keep track of the behaviour.
      <me>
        \zeta \defeq \frac{b}{2\sqrt{km}}
      </me>
      The damping constant gives a nice measure of the friction. If
      <m>\zeta \lt  1</m> then the system is underdamped and there is 
      sinusoidal behaviour. If <m>\zeta = 1</m> the situation is
      critically damped and if <m>\zeta > 1</m>, the situation is
      overdamped; in both cases, there is exponential decay without
      oscillations. The frictionless case is <m>\zeta = 0</m>. Let me
      return to the frictionless case for a moment. The solutions when
      <m>\zeta = 0</m> are
      <me>
        y = A \cos \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} t + B \sin \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} t
      </me>.
      Now I will define a second important constant. 
      <me>
        \omega \defeq \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
      </me>
      This constant is called the natural frequency. It represents
      the frequency of sinusoidal oscillation in a perfect system
      without friction. (Note that all of the frequencies in this
      section are not true frequencies: they are off by a factor of
      <m>\frac{1}{2\pi}</m>. However, I'll ignore this fact and keep
      referring to them as frequencies.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I'll define a third important constant. 
      <me>
        \lambda \defeq \frac{b}{2m}
      </me>
      If I look back to the underdamped case, the exponential decay
      term can be written <m>e^{-\lambda t}</m>. Therefore,
      <m>\lambda</m> is called the decay coefficient. With these new
      constants, the roots of the characteristic equation become <m>r
      = -\lambda +\pm \imath \sqrt{\omega^2 - \lambda^2}</m> and I
      can rewrite the homogeneous differential equation as <me>
      y^{\prime \prime} + 2\lambda y^\prime + \omega^2 y = 0 </me>.
      Now return to the idea of a sinusoidal forcing term
      <m>f(t) = F\sin \gamma t</m> with some frequency <m>\gamma</m>.
      I want to look at four situations to understand the effect of
      this force and the possibility of resonance.

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-no-friction-no-forcing">
    <title>Situation 1: No Friction, No Forcing</title>
    <p>
      This is the trivial base case, where the system just oscillates
      forever with frequency <m>\omega</m>. This frequency is called
      the natural frequency because it describes the dynamics of this
      trival base case, even if the ideal frictionless situation isn't
      particularly natural.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsection-no-friction-forcing">
    <title>Situation 2: No Friction, Forcing</title>
    <p>
      The differential equation in this case has the form
      <me>
        y^{\prime \prime} + \omega^2 y = F \sin \gamma t
      </me>.
      This is something that I can solve with undetermined
      coefficients in two subcases. In the first sub-case, I assume
      that <m>\gamma \neq \omega</m>. Then
      the forcing term is unlike the homogeneous solutions and I can
      make the following guess for the particular solution.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          y_p \amp = C \sin \gamma t + D \cos \gamma t
        </mrow>
      </md>
        I'll take the derivatives of the particular solution, put them
        in the differential equation, and compare coefficients to get
        a system of two equations. 
      <md>
        <mrow>
          y_p^\prime \amp = \gamma C \cos \gamma t - \gamma D \sin
          \gamma t
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          y_p^{\prime \prime} \amp = -\gamma^2 C \sin \gamma t -
          \gamma^2 D \cos \gamma t
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          Ly_p \amp = (-\gamma^2 C + \omega^2 C) \sin \gamma t +
          (-\gamma^2 D + \omega^2 D) \cos \gamma t = F \sin \gamma t
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          -\gamma^2 C + \omega^2 C \amp = F \implies C =
          \frac{F}{\omega^2 - \gamma^2 }
        </mrow>
      </md>
        The two equations in the system are independent, since the
        first only <m>C</m> and the second only involves <m>D</m>.
        I'll solve them each and use the results to write the
        particular solution. The full solution is then the homogeneous
        solution (which is case 1 without forcing, so uses the natural
        frequency <m>\omega</m>) plus this new particular solution. 
      <md>
        <mrow>
          -\gamma^2 D + \omega^2 D \amp = 0 \implies D = 0
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          y_p \amp = \frac{F}{\omega^2 - \gamma^2} \sin \gamma t
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          y \amp = A \sin \omega t + B \cos \omega t +
          \frac{F}{\omega^2 - \gamma^2} \sin \gamma t
        </mrow>
      </md>
      The particular solution is a sine wave with
      amplitutde <m>\frac{F}{\omega^2 - \gamma^2}</m>. The closer the
      forcing frequency is to the natural frequency, the greater the
      amplitude of the resulting oscillation. (The restriction
      <m>\gamma \neq \omega</m> is also obviously important here to
      avoid division by zero.) If I impose the initial conditions
      <m>y(0) = 0</m> and <m>y^\prime(0) = 0</m>, then the system is
      initially at rest and the only energy in the system comes from
      the external forcing. In this case, I can calculate that
      <m>B=0</m> from the first initial condition. The calculation for
      the second initial condition is as follows.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          y^{\prime} \amp = \omega A \cos \omega t + \frac{\gamma
          F}{\omega^2 - \gamma^2} \cos \gamma t
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          y^\prime (0) \amp = A \omega + \frac{\gamma F}{\omega^2 -
          \gamma^2} = 0 \implies A = \frac{-\gamma F}{\omega(\omega^2
          - \gamma^2)}
        </mrow>
      </md>
      Then I can write the unique solution for this initial value
      problems. I do a bit of algebra to write it in common
      denominator. 
      <md>
        <mrow>
          y \amp = \frac{-\gamma F}{\omega( \omega^2 - \gamma^2)} \sin
          \omega t + \frac{F}{\omega^2 - \gamma^2} \sin \gamma t =
          \frac{-\gamma F \sin \omega t + \omega F \sin \gamma
          t}{\omega (\omega^2 - \gamma^2)}
        </mrow>
      </md>
      Now, to answer the question of resonance, I'll take the limit 
      of this solution as <m>\gamma \rightarrow \omega</m>. The
      denominator is undefined, but the numerator also evaluates to
      <m>0</m>, so I can apply L'HÃ´pital's rule to calculate the
      limit. After the derivative of the numerator and the
      denominator, the resulting limit can be calculated directly. 
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \lim_{\gamma \rightarrow \omega} \frac{-\gamma F \sin \omega
          t + \omega F \sin \gamma t}{\omega (\omega^2 - \gamma^2)}
          \amp = \lim_{\gamma \rightarrow \omega} \frac{-F \sin \omega
          t + \omega t F \cos \gamma t}{-2\gamma \omega}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp = \frac{-F \sin \omega t + \omega t F \cos \omega t}{-2
          \omega^2}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp = \frac{F}{2\omega^2} \sin \omega t - \frac{Ft \cos
          \omega t}{2\omega}
        </mrow>
      </md>
      The result of the limit has a <m>t \cos \omega t</m> term, which
      is a sinusoidal wave with linear growth in amplitude. The
      amplidute of the system will grow linearly without bound. This
      is the ideal (frictionless) understanding of resonance, where
      the oscillations of the system continue to grow with larger and
      larger amplitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a justification, if you want, of why multiplying by
      <m>t</m> gives the particular solutions when there is a forcing
      term similar to the homogeneous solutions. When <m>\gamma =
      \omega</m>, the forcing is already a homogeneous solution
      That's precisely what happens in the resonant case <mdash /> in
      the limit <m>\gamma \rightarrow \omega</m>. It is also what we
      would have found if we with <m>\omega = \gamma</m> and used
      undetermined coefficients, instead of using the limit process.
      When the forcing term lines up perfectly with the natural
      frequency, there is an additional linear growth term in the
      resulting solution, due to resonance.

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-friction-no-forcing">
    <title>Section 3: Friction, No Forcing</title>
    <p>
      In the third case, I finally include friction. Using the new
      constant, I can write the general homogeneous SOCCLDE as
      folllows 
      <me>
        y^{\prime \prime} + 2\lambda y^\prime + \omega^2 y = 0
      </me>.
      The characteristic equation is <m>r^2 + 2\lambda r +
      \omega^2</m> with roots <m>-\lambda \pm \imath \sqrt{\omega^2 -
      \lambda^2}</m>. If I let <m>\omega_d = \sqrt{\omega^2 -
      \lambda^2}</m>, then the homogeneous solutions are
      <me>
        y= e^{-\lambda t} (A \cos \omega_d t + B \sin \omega_d t)
      </me>.
      The new constant <m>\omega_d</m> is called the damped frequency.
      It is not the same as the natural frequency, since friction
      changes the <sq>natural</sq> frequency of oscillations of the
      system. I can explicitly state the relationship between damped
      and natural frequency via rewriting the constants. From the
      definitions of the constants, the following identity is true. 
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \amp \lambda^2 = \frac{\zeta^2}{\omega^2} \amp \amp \implies 
          \amp \amp \lambda^2 \omega^2 = \zeta^2
        </mrow>
      </md>.
      Using this, I can write the relationship between the damped
      frequency and the natural frequency. 
      <me>
        \omega_d = \omega \sqrt{1 - \zeta^2}
      </me>.
      With friction involved and no forcing, the system will display
      sinusoidally decaying oscillations where the frequency is this
      <m>\omega_d</m>. As an interesting aside, as <m>\zeta</m>
      approaches <m>1</m> and the systemapproach the critical damped
      situation with simple exponential decay, this damped frequency
      approaches zero. This explains the transition from sinusoidal
      to exponential behaviour, which might have seemed like a strange
      transition. As friction increases and the system approaches the
      critically damped situation, the wavelength of the sine wave
      (which is a reciprocal of frequency) grows to <m>\infty</m>. The
      wave stretches out further and further until there isn't any
      wave left at all, just an exponential decay.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this third case, the damped frequency completely described
      the behaviour (along with the decay coefficient). There isn't
      resonance until a forcing term is added. 
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsection-friction-forcing">
    <title>Situation 4: Friction and Forcing</title>
    <p>
      If I finally include both friction and a forcing term, I can use
      the new constant to rewrite the DE as
      <me>
        y^{\prime\prime} + 2\lambda y^\prime + \omega^2 y = F \sin
        \gamma t
      </me>
      where <m>\gamma</m> again is the forcing frequency. 
      The homogeneous solutions are known from the previous case and
      depend on the damped frequency. 
      <me>
        y_h = e^{-\lambda t} (A \cos \omega_d t + B \sin \omega_d t)
      </me>
      Since the forcing lacks the exponential term, it is not the same
      as the homogeneous solutions even if <m>\gamma = \omega_d</m>. I
      don't need any subcases here: I can use undetermined
      coefficients without any alteration. Like case 2, I use
      undetermined coefficients to solve for the particular solution.
      I start with the guess for the particular solution based on the
      forcing term.

      As time passes, the homogeneous solutions fall out and only the
      term with the forcing frequency <m>\gamma</m> remains. What is
      its amplitude? The term is a linear combination of a sine and
      cosine wave with the same frequencies, so I can use <xref
      ref="proposition-wave-combination" /> to combine the result into
      one sinusoidal wave. What I care about, for the purposes of
      resonance, is just the amplitude of that wave. Using the
      proposition, I calculate that amplitude. 
      <me>

        \frac{F}{\sqrt{(\omega^2 - \gamma^2)^2 + 4 \gamma^2
        \lambda^2}}
      </me>
      The question of resonance is this: if the magnitude of the force
      <m>F</m> is fixed, what is the maximum amplitude can be achieved
      by altering the forcing frequency? Note this amplitude is always
      finite <mdash/> with friction, there is no infinite growth of
      amplitude as there was in the second case. (This is expected
      predicted, since I didn't need to multiply by <m>t</m> when we
      setup the undetermined coefficients.) However, the amplitude can
      be quite large. This is a optimization problem, so I
      differentiate the expression for amplitude and find its critical
      points. (Not that I am looking to optimize by amplitude, so the
      function and the derivative are in the variable <m>\gamma</m>).

      I'll skip the testing of intervals to classify this critical
      point; this is, indeed, a maximum for amplitude. Now I want to
      write this result is a slightly different way. Recall that
      <m>\lambda^2 = \omega^2 \zeta^2</m>. I can use that to factor
      <m>\omega</m> out of the expression for <m>\gamma</m>.
      <me>
        \gamma = \sqrt{\omega^2 - 2 \zeta^2 \omega^2} = \omega \sqrt{1
        - 2 \zeta^2}
      </me>.
      This is the resonant frequency. However, how can I be 
      certain that it exists? I need <m>1-2\zeta^2</m> to be
      positive to define this square root. This implies, certainly,
      that <m>\zeta \lt  1</m>, which I assumed when I decided to
      work with the underdamped case (that assumption is now
      justified). However, the inequality is stricter.
      <me>
        \zeta^2 \leq \frac{1}{2} \implies \zeta \leq
        \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
      </me>
      The bound for the damping coefficient is smaller than simply for
      the underdamped case. I conclude that resonant frequency only
      exists is the friction is small enough, measured by this
      <m>\zeta \lt \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}</m>. In particular, if I am
      concerned about safety and want to avoid the situation of
      resonant frequency, this calculation lets me know the minimum
      friction I need to build into the system to avoid the
      possibility of resonance.
