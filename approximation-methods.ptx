  <title>Approximation Methods and Applications for First Order Equations</title>
  <p>
    At this point, many DE courses might include a section on
    approximation methods or a section on applications, or both. I
    will be not spending any time on either of these.

    The applications are useful for motivation.  The approximation
    methods are interesting due to the fact, observed previously, that
    many DEs are terribly difficult to solve.  The techniques I
    included above for first order equations cover only a small
    portion of all the possible equations and even then, I have to
    rely on integrals for seperable and linear equations.  Integrals
    themselves are difficult and often only possible up to
    approximation.  Therefore, a huge part of the mathematics of
    differential equations is the study of approximation techniques.
    Getting a sense of how these approximations are set up is an
    important insight into the field.
