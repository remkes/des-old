  <title>Legendre Functions</title>
  <p>
    There is a nice example of series solutions which deserves its own
    section, since it leads to an important class of functions. Let
    <m>k \in \NN</m> and consider the differential equation <me>
    (1-t^2)y^{\prime \prime} - 2ty^\prime + k(k+1)y=0 </me>. I need
    to divide by <m>1-t^2</m> to get this DE in standard form,
    implying that <m>t = \pm 1</m> are singular points. A solution
    centered at <m>0</m> should have radius of convergence at least
    <m>R=1</m>. 
    <md>
      <mrow>
        (1-t^2)y^{\prime \prime} - 2ty^\prime + k(k+1) y \amp =
        (1-t^2) \sum_{n=2}^\infty c_n n(n-1)t^{n-2}
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        0 \amp - 2t \sum_{n=1}^\infty c_n nt^{n-1} +k(k+1)
        \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n t^n
      </mrow>
    </md>
    I've taken the derivatives of the series and inserted them. Then I
    multiply the powers of <m>t</m> into the sums. Then I'll follow
    the standard steps: I'll shift to make the exponents match, pull
    out initial terms to make the indices match, then combine the sums
    into one.

    I need all these coefficients to be zero. I leave <m>c_0</m>
    and <m>c_1</m> as unknown parameters, since I haven't imposed
    initial conditions. The first two isolated terms (the constant and
    the linear term) give unique equations for their coefficients.

    The remaining terms are determined by the recurrence relation.
    I'll do some algebra with the complicated term inside the sum to
    try to make the recurrence relation clear.

    The pattern continues and gives two series, one for the
    <m>c_0</m> terms and one for the <m>c_1</m> terms.
  </p>
  <p>
    I assumed that <m>k \in \NN</m>. Now I'll consider two cases: 
    <m>k</m> even or <m>k</m> odd. If <m>k</m> is odd, then the term
    involving <m>c_1</m> eventually has <m>(k-k)</m> in the numerator.
    That means the numerator will be zero: this recurrence
    relationship eventually stop and there is a polynomial solution. If
    <m>k</m> is even, then terms involving <m>c_0</m> eventually have
    <m>(k-k)</m> in the numerator, and again there is a polynomial
    solution. So, for any <m>k</m>, I find a polynomial solution.
    (Note this extends the expected radius of convergence. I am 
    only guaranteed a radius of <m>R=1</m>, but polynomials converge
    everywhere, so <m>R=\infty</m>).
  </p>
  <p>
    These special polynomial solutions are the solutions I am 
    interested in. They are called Legendre Polynomials for <m>k \in
    \NN</m>. They are historically important special functions with
    several other important properties in addition to the property of
    solving the Legendre DE. I'll calculate the first few. There is 
    the unknown <m>c_0</m> or <m>c_1</m> to consider; I'll always
    choose <m>c_0</m> or <m>c_1</m> so that the polynomial goes
    through the point <m>(1,1)</m>. (Which is equivalent to the
    initial condition <m>y(1) = 1</m>.) This convention leads to one
    of the important properties of the Legendre polynomials.

    I can notice a number of interesting properties. First, all the
    even <m>P_k</m> are even functions, all the odd are odd. The even
    one all pass through <m>(-1,1)</m> and <m>(1,1)</m>. All the odd
    ones pass through <m>(-1,-1)</m> and <m>(1,1)</m>. (It is
    conventional to only work with the Legendre polynomials on the
    domain <m>[-1,1]</m>.) I can also notice interesting patterns in
    the coefficients. There are powers of <m>2</m> in the
    denominators, but some are skipped. Interesting patterns are also
    found in the prime divisors of the numerators.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here's a list of further interesting properties.
    <md>
      <mrow>
        P_k(-t) \amp = (-1)^k P_k(t)
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        \int_{-1}^1 P_k(t) P_l(t) \amp = \frac{2}{2l+1} \delta_{kl}
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        0 \amp = (k+1)P_{k+1}(t) - (2k+1)tP_k(t) + k P_{k-1}(t) 
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        (2k+1) P_k(t) \amp = \frac{d}{dt} \left( P_{k+1}(t) -
        P_{k-1}(t) \right)
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        P_k(t) \amp = \sum_{j=0}^k (-1)^j \binom{k}{j}^2 \left(
        \frac{1+t}{2} \right)^{k-j} \left( \frac{1-t}{2} \right)^j
      </mrow>
    </md>
    The <m>\delta_{kl}</m> in the second property is the Kronecker
    delta. It evalutes to <m>1</m> if <m>k=l</m> and to <m>0</m>
    otherwise. It's a very useful piece of notation. This second
    property is an orthogonality property: if I define an inner
    product of two functions as the integral of their product over
    <m>[-1,1]</m>, then the Legendre polynomials are all orthogonal to
    each other. In linear algebra language, they form an orthogonal
    basis for the infinite dimensional linear space of polynomials
    (with this particular inner product). Orthogonal bases are nice
    to work with, another fact that recommends the Legendre
    polynomials.
  </p>
  <p>
    The third property is called the functional equation. This
    section is the start of a whole branch of mathematicals on
    so-called <sq>special functions</sq>. The existence of a
    functional equation which relates members of the family to each
    other is quite typical for special functions.
  </p>
  <p>
    As an interesting aside, I'll very briefly detour to talk about
    generating functions.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty</m> is a sequence of real numbers,
        a generating function for the sequence is a Taylor series (or
        other series in some contexts) where the <m>a_n</m> are the
        series coefficients.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    In some way, the generating function <sq>knows</sq> the properties
    of the sequence. I will share two interesting examples.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In some way, the function on the left relates to and accounts
        for the sequences of integer squares.
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \amp \frac{t(t+1)}{(1-t)^3} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty n^2 t^n
            \amp \amp |t| \lt  1
          </mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Again, this strange polynomial/exponential function somehow
        captures the sequence of squares divided by factorials. 
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \amp t(t+1)e^t = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{n^2}{n!} t^n \amp
            \amp t \in \RR
          </mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    It turns out, if I briefly consider functions
    of two variables, that there are generating functions for Legendre
    polynomials. This relevant identity is
    <me>
      \frac{1}{\sqrt{1- 2tx+x^2}} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty P_k(t) x^n
    </me>.
    Somehome, this strange two-variables square root functions
    <sq>knows</sq> all the Legendre polynomials. There are all there,
    encoded in the Taylor series coefficients.
