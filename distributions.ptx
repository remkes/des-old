  <title>Distributions</title>
  <p>
    In the world of functional analysis and the use of transforms,
    it turns out we can extend our notion of a function in strange and novel ways.
    While I'm not going to give a formal definition,
    these extensions are called distributions.
    The basic idea is that a distribution may not be a well-defined function,
    but it is something that behaves well in integration. (If the word <sq>distribution</sq> reminds you of probability and statistics,
    that's a good intuition.
    These distributions are very similar to distributions used in statistics).
  </p>
  <p>
    The distribution we will be using in this section is the <m>\delta</m>-function.
    (The name is terrible, since it is most certainly
    <em>not</em> a function.)
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <m>\delta</m>-function is a distribution with values
        <me>
          \delta_a(t) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} \infty \amp  t = a \\ 0 \amp  t \neq a \end{matrix} \right.
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a function,
        since <m>\infty</m> is not a valid output for a function.
        However, this does give us an intuition.
        We can think of <m>\delta_a(t)</m> as a thing which is zero away from <m>t=a</m> and has an infinitely tall spike at <m>t=a</m>.
        Often, this is defined by a limit.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Let <m>b > 0</m> and consider the bell curve function <m>\frac{\sqrt{b}}{\sqrt{\pi}} e^{-b(t-a)^2}</m>.
    All of these functions have integral <m>1</m>,
    by design of the choice of the coefficient.
    <me>
      \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{\sqrt{b}}{\sqrt{\pi}} e^{-b(t-a)^2} dt = \frac{\sqrt{b}}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-b(t-a)^2} dt = \frac{\sqrt{b}}{\sqrt{\pi}} \frac{ \sqrt{\pi}}{\sqrt{b}} = 1

  <p>
    These functions are all bell curves,
    but they become taller and narrower at <m>b</m> increases.
    <xref ref="figure-bell-curves">Figure</xref>
    shows the progression of these bell curves.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then we could define <m>\delta_a(t)</m> as
    <me>
      \delta_a(t) = \lim_{b \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\sqrt{b}}{\sqrt{\pi}} e^{b(t-a)^2}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The delta function is the limit of these functions.
    The intuition before,
    of an infinitely narrow and infinitely tall spike, fits this limit process,
    since the bell curves are becoming taller and narrower with each step.
    The value of the integral is unchanged for the entire limit process.
    Since integration works well with limits,
    the integral of the delta function should be 1.
    <me>
      \int_{-\infty}^\infty \delta_a(t) dt = 1
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    We said that distribution worked well with integration and we just defined the integral of <m>\delta_a</m> over <m>\RR</m>.
    Now we can think about integrating products <m>f(t) \delta_a(t)</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we integrate <m>f(t) \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{\pi}} e^{-at^2}</m>,
    we get a weighted average of <m>f(t)</m> values near <m>a</m>.
    In the limit, though, only the value at <m>f(a)</m> matters,
    since we multiply by zero everywhere else.
    This gives the most convenient proprety of <m>\delta</m>-function.
    <me>
      \int_{-\infty}^\infty \delta_a (t) f(t) dt = f(a)
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    In some sense,
    the <m>\delta</m>-functions are the nicest possible functions to integrate,
    since their integrals are just evaluations of functions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the <m>\delta</m>-function,
    and distributions in general,
    work well with integration, we can take their Laplace transforms.
    The Laplace transform for the <m>\delta</m>-function is very easy to calculate.
    <me>
      \calL \{ \delta_a(t) \} (s) = \int_0^\infty \delta_a (t) e^{-st} dt = \left\{ \begin{matrix} 0 \amp  a \lt  0 \\ 1 \amp  a = 0 \\ e^{-as} \amp  a \geq 0 \end{matrix} \right.
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, this is quite an odd result.
    We started with a distribution which wasn't even a proper function,
    but it's Laplace transform is a proper,
    well-behaved differentiable function.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before we end this section,
    we can ask why we would define such a strange function.
    Let's think about harmonic systems and forcing terms again.
    The <m>\delta</m>-function can act as a forcing term;
    if it does, it represents an instantaneous jolt to the system.
    The standard image of a harmonic system is a mass on a spring.
    In this image,
    a <m>\delta</m>-function represents hitting the mass with a hammer at one moment in time.
    The force only acts for an instant,
    but it transfers some finite energy and causes a change in the system.
