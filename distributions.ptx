  <title>Distributions</title>
  <p>
    In analysis (the world of transformation, non-elementary
    functions, etc.) I can extend the notion of a function in strange
    and novel ways. While I'm not going to give a formal definition,
    these extensions are called distributions. The basic idea is that
    a distribution may not be a well-defined function, but it is
    something that behaves well in integration. (If the word
    <sq>distribution</sq> reminds you of probability and statistics,
    that's a good intuition. These distributions are very similar to
    distributions used in statistics where, again, the ability to
    integrate is the most important property).
  </p>
  <p>
    The distribution I want to share in this section is the
    <m>\delta</m>-function. (The name is terrible, since it is most
    certainly <em>not</em> a function.) Here is the definition. Since
    the most important thing to know about a distribution is how to
    integrate it, I'll define the <m>\delta</m>-function by its
    integration property. 
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <m>\delta</m>-function centred at <m>a \in \RR</m> is the
        unique distribution that satisfies the following two
        integration properties. Let <m>f(t)</m> be any integrable
        function with domain <m>\RR</m>.
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \int_{-\infty}^\infty \delta_a(t) dt \amp = 1
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            \int_{-\infty}^\infty \delta_a (t) f(t) dt \amp = f(a)
          </mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    This is a good definition, but not a very clear one. What is this
    distribution <mdash /> how is it like a function and what function
    is it like? The best way to define the <m>\delta</m>-function is
    as a limit of other function, which I'll try to do now.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>b \in \NN</m> and consider the bell curve functions
    <m>\frac{\sqrt{b}}{\sqrt{\pi}} e^{-b(t-a)^2}</m>. All of these
    functions have integral <m>1</m>, by design of the choice of the
    constnat involved. 
    <me>
      \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{\sqrt{b}}{\sqrt{\pi}} e^{-b(t-a)^2}
      dt = \frac{\sqrt{b}}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty
      e^{-b(t-a)^2} dt = \frac{\sqrt{b}}{\sqrt{\pi}} \frac{
      \sqrt{\pi}}{\sqrt{b}} = 1
    </me>
    These functions are all bell curves, but they become taller and
    narrower at <m>b</m> increases. <xref ref="figure-bell-curves" />
    shows the progression of these bell curves.

    Then I could define <m>\delta_0(t)</m> as the limit of the
    sequences of bell curves as <m>b \rightarrow \infty</m>.
    <me>
      \delta_0(t) = \lim_{b \rightarrow \infty}
      \frac{\sqrt{b}}{\sqrt{\pi}} e^{b(t-a)^2}
    </me>
    The limit of a sequence of function is a strange idea and I'm not
    going to go into the technical details of limits of functions and
    the resulting distribution. (There is a theory for this, as part
    of real analysis.) But I can talk about the intuition. In the
    sequences of functions, the bell curves are becoming taller and
    narrower with each step. In the limit, I produce something that
    becomes infinitely narrow and infinitely tall. However, the area
    under the curve for any function in the limit is 1, so the value
    of the integral should be unchanged.
    <me>
      \int_{-\infty}^\infty \delta_0(t) dt = 1
    </me>
    Since the result of the limit is essentially just an infinitely
    tall, infinitely narrow spike, sometimes the
    <m>\delta</m>-function is defined as follows.  
    <me>
      \delta_a(t) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} \infty \amp t = a \\ 0
      \amp t \neq a \end{matrix} \right.
    </me>
    This is very strange, since <m>\infty</m> is not a number and
    shouldn't be the output of a function. Indeed, this is not a
    function (even though it is named, poorly,  as <sq>the
    <m>\delta</m>-function</sq>). But this does get at the idea of
    the <m>\delta</m>-function. In many introductory situations, this
    piecewise definition is, indeed, given as the definition; I prefer
    to give the integration definition, since it is better practice.
  </p>
  <p>
    The previous limit defined the <m>\delta</m>-function centred at
    <m>a=0</m>. In many books, this is simiply written
    <m>\delta(t)</m>, without the subscript. The other
    <m>\delta</m>-function are simply shifts of this distribution.
    <me>
      \delta_a(t) = \delta_0(t-a)
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, I could integrate the product of the bell curve sequence
    and some other function <m>f(t)</m> with domain <m>\RR</m>. 
    If I integrate <m>f(t) \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{\pi}} e^{-at^2}</m>,
    I get a weighted average of <m>f(t)</m> values near <m>a</m>. In
    the limit, though, only the value at <m>f(a)</m> matters, since
    the <m>\delta</m>-function multiplies by zero everywhere else.
    The weighted average of just one value is simply that value, so I
    can argue (informally) for the second property of the 
    <m>\delta</m>-function.
    <me>
      \int_{-\infty}^\infty \delta_a (t) f(t) dt = f(a)
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the <m>\delta</m>-function, and distributions in general,
    can be integrated, I can take their Laplace transforms.
    The Laplace transform for the <m>\delta</m>-function is very easy
    to calculate. (Indeed, the <m>\delta</m>-function is the nicest
    and easiest function to integrate in basically any circumstance
    due to its second property.) 
    <me>
      \calL \{ \delta_a(t) \} (s) = \int_0^\infty \delta_a (t) e^{-st}
      dt = \left\{ \begin{matrix} 0 \amp a \lt  0 \\ 1 \amp a = 0 \\
      e^{-as} \amp a \geq 0 \end{matrix} \right.
    </me>
    This is quite an odd result. I started with a distribution which
    wasn't even a proper function, but it's Laplace transform is a
    proper, well-behaved differentiable function.  Laplace transforms
    don't even exclusively send functions to functions, but allow for
    distributions as well. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Before I end this section, I can ask why I would define such a
    strange function. Think about harmonic systems and forcing
    terms again. The <m>\delta</m>-function can act as a forcing
    term; if it does, it represents an instantaneous jolt to the
    system. The standard image of a harmonic system is a mass on a
    spring. In this image, a <m>\delta</m>-function represents
    hitting the mass with a hammer at one moment in time. The force
    only acts for an instant, but it transfers some finite energy and
    causes a change in the system. Like step functions modelling
    switches, the <m>\delta</m> functions models sudden impact, which
    is very reasonable and useful for applications.
