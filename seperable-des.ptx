  <title>Seperable Equations</title>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>seperable equation</term>
        is a DE which has the form
        <me>
          \frac{dy}{dt} = f(y) g(t)
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    The method of solving seperable equations treats the <m>dt</m> and <m>dy</m> terms as independent infinitesimals,
    a strange but historically reasonable treatment.
    If we allow for these independent infinitesimals, we can seperate
    (hence the name)
    the DE into two pieces, one involving each variable.
    <me>
      \frac{1}{f(y)} dy = g(t) dt
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Then, again acting somewhat strangely by modern notational conventions,
    we integrate both sides with respect to their own variables.
    <me>
      \int \frac{1}{f(y)} dy = \int g(t) dt
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    The solution is then left implicit unless we can reasonable solve for <m>y</m>,
    in which case we can write <m>y</m> as a conventional function of <m>t</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are interested in the justification of this splitting procedure,
    we could think of the operation alternatively,
    writing <m>f(y(t))</m> to remember the independent variable.
    If we bring the <m>f(y)</m> to the left side, we get the expression
    <me>
      \frac{1}{f(y(t))} \frac{dy}{dt} = g(t)
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then we can integrate both sides with respect to <m>t</m>,
    which is a reasonable and justified operation.
    <me>
      \int \frac{1}{f(y(t))} \frac{dy}{dt} dt = \int g(t) dt
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, we change of variables from <m>t</m> to <m>y</m> in the left side integral.
    <me>
      \int \frac{1}{f(y)} dy = \int g(t) dt
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    In theory, we should get two constants of integration,
    one from each side.
    However, we can move the left side constant to the ride side and have the difference of two arbitrary constants,
    which is equivalent to one arbitrary constant.
    Therefore, we will only write on constant of integration for seperable equations.
  </p>
  <p>
    In general, mathematicians have a practice of being somewhat careless with this constant.
    Since it doesn't need to be determined until we use an initial condition,
    we often forgoe various operations on the constant.
    For example, if we had <m>2(t+c)</m>,
    we would often simplify this to <m>2t+c</m>,
    since whether we figure out the constant from <m>c</m> or from <m>2c</m> later,
    its value is still determined by the initial condition.
    It's useful to become accustomed to this carelessness constants of integration.

  <example>
    <statement>
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{dy}{dx} \amp  = \frac{\sin x}{y}</mrow>
        <mrow>y dy \amp  = \sin x dx</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{y^2}{2} \amp  = - \cos x + c</mrow>
        <mrow>y \amp  = \pm \sqrt{c - 2\cos x}</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        It is interesting to note where the constant of integration ends up.
        Since integration isn't the final step
        (we have to also solve for <m>y</m>),
        the constant moves around in the resulting algebra.
        In DE, we can't just add <m>+c</m> at the very end of the process.

        If we impose an initial condition of <m>y(0) = 1</m>,
        we can determined the value of the constant of integration.

    shows the direction field and solution for this example.
    Notice the strange domain issues with this implicit plot.
    When <m>|c| \leq 2</m>, we have restricted domain solutions,
    represented by the closed curves.
    There are no solutions at all when <m>c \lt -2</m>.
    We have solutions with domain <m>\RR</m> only for <m>c \geq 2</m>.
    When <m>c = 2</m>, we get the strange crossed graph,
    which is not always differentiable.
    When <m>c=-2</m>. the
    <q>solution</q>
    is only defined at discrete points.

    <statement>
      <p>
        This is an autonomous example.
        <md>
          <mrow>\frac{dy}{dx} \amp  = y^2 - 4</mrow>
          <mrow>\int \frac{1}{y^2-4} dy \amp  = \int 1 dx</mrow>
          <mrow>\frac{-1}{2} \arctanh \left( \frac{y}{2} \right) \amp  = x + c</mrow>
          <mrow>\arctanh \left( \frac{y}{2} \right) \amp  = -2x + c</mrow>
          <mrow>\frac{y}{2} \amp  = \tanh (-2x + c)</mrow>
          <mrow>y \amp  = 2 \tanh (-2x + c)</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since this is an autonomous equation,
        we can look for steady (constant) singular solutions when the right side of the equation vanishes.
        Here, <m>y=2</m> and <m>y=-2</m> are steady states.
        Moreover, <m>y=2</m> is stable and <m>y=-2</m> is unstable.
        This can be seen in the direction field and implicit plot in <xref ref="figure-direction-field7">Figure</xref>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also interesting to note that the output of <m>\tanh</m> is only <m>-1</m> to <m>1</m>,
        so it is impossible to get <m>y \leq -2</m> or <m>y \geq 2</m>.
        We should wonder if there are solutions in this range at all.
        In the implicit plot, we could draw curves with these <m>y</m> values.
        These other curves are found by doing the integral differently,
        since both hyperbolic tangent and hyperbolic cotangent have the same anti-derivative.
        <m>y=2 \coth (-2x + c)</m> is also a solution.
