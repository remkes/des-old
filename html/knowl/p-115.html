<p>I should make one note about the constant on integration that arises in this solution method (and in many other as well). Since the constant of integraiton will eventually be determined by an initial value, mathematicians are often quite careless with the artihmetic of this constant. For example, if the following expression shows up <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(2(t+c)\text{,}\)</span> I would often simplify this to <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(2t+c\)</span> instead of <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(2t + 2c\text{,}\)</span> since whether I eventually figure out the constant from <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(c\)</span> or from <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(2c\)</span> later, its value is still determined by the initial condition. This is a strange carelessness after all the care mathematicians have always preached about arithmetic and algebra, but it is, in fact, justified. Let me now move on to some examples of solving separable equations.</p>
