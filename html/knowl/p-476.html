<p>The difference between linear systems and non-linear systems is immensely important. I'll demonstrate some exactly solutions for linear system (with constant coefficients) in <a href="section-linear-systems.html" class="internal" title="Section 6.3: Linear Systems">SectionÂ 6.3</a>. However, the key examples to follow will be entirely non-linear. One might wonder why it is still useful to study linear systems after the motivating examples show such linearity. There are, in fact, strong reasons to still understand linear systems. Often, the linear approximation to a non-linear system can demonstrate many of the dynamics of the system. This approximation also is an important first step to understanding the non-linear, introducing the complication as an adjustment to the linear approximation.</p>
