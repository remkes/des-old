<p>The initial condition determines the situation at the starting time. However, we also need to control the behaviour of position. For position, instead of initial conditions, we have boundary conditions. These tell us the behaviour of the system at its boundaries. For the heat equation on a rod, we have \(x\in [0,\pi]\text{,}\) so the boundary contitions are determination of \(u(0,t)\) and \(u(\pi,t)\text{.}\) These themselves can be functions of \(t\text{.}\) However, for our purposes, we'll set the boundary contitions to be constant. If we set the units of temperature reasonably, we can have \(u(0,t) = u(\pi,t) = 0\text{.}\) These boundary condition mean that we have a constant temperature at both ends of the rod at all moments in time. (In physical terms, there are perfect instantaneous heat-sinks at each end of the rod which equalize it to the ambient temperature of zero).</p>
