<p>At this point, many DE courses might include a section on approximation methods or a section on applications, or both. The applications are useful for motivation.  The approximation methods are interesting due to the fact, observed previously, that many DEs are terribly difficult to solve.  The techniques I included above for first order equations cover only a small portion of all the possible equations and even then, I have to rely on integrals for seperable and linear equations.  Integrals themselves are difficult and often only possible up to approximation.  Therefore, a huge part of the mathematics of differential equations is the study of approximation techniques. Getting a sense of how these approximations are set up is an important insight into the field.</p>
