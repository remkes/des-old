<p>Undetermined coefficients is an effective and efficient (relatively speaking!) way to solve for a particular non-homogeneous solution of a SOLCCDE. It's restriction is its scope: it only works for specific forcing terms. Variation of parameters is a much more general method of finding particular solutions. It's weakness is the reliance on difficult integrals â€” often we'll have to leave the solutions in a form which involves unfinished integrals. In the examples, we'll often stick to forcing terms which could have used undetermined coefficients, just to make the integrals reasonable.</p>
