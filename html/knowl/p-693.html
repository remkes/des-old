<p>The general solution in this case is the sum of this steady There are many pieces to the setup and solution of a PDE. In what we've done so far for the heat equation, we allowed a nearly-arbitrary initial conditions, since any function which has a Fourier series satisfied. However, our boundary conditions were very restrictive. We can get more complicated situations if we relax the boundary conditions. A small increase in complexity comes from constant but non-equal boundary conditions: \(u(0,t) = A\) and \(u(\pi,t) = B\) for some constants \(A\) and \(B\text{.}\) This is a situation where we will keep the ends of the rod at constant temperature, but those temperatures need not be the same.</p>
