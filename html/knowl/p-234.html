<li><p>Resistors allow for energy leaving the system and they represent the resistance to energy flow. The resistance is written <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(R\)</span> and measured in ohms. It acts like friction in the mechanical system in that it wants to slow down the flow of current. Resistance will result in a decrease in current over time, if there is no external forcing. Resistors represent the devices powered by the circuit, whatever those devices are. As the parallel of friction, resistance should show up as the coefficient of <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(\frac{dq}{dt}\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Capacitors are storage devices for electrical energy in electric fields. They have a measurement <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(c\)</span> called capacitance, which has units of farads (coloumbs per volt). They stabilize alternating current flow; as such, they can be see as controlling the natural way in which current flows. Thise idea (up to a reciprocal) aligns with the idea of spring constant, which represented the stiffness of the spring and controlled the natural behaviour of the harmonic system (before friction and external forces). As the analogue of the spring constant, capacitance should show up as the coefficient of <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(x(t)\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Inductors are storage devices for electrical energy in a magnetic field. They have a measurement <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(L\)</span> called inductance, which has units of henrys. Inductors block alternating current; as such, they represent the difficulty of moving charge through the system. In the harmonic system, the difficult of moving the object was its mass (indeed, a simple definition of mass is a measure of how difficult it is to move an object). As the analogue of the mass, inductance should show up as the coefficient of <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Electromotive forces are external forces to the system, from batteries or generators. They are written <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(E(t)\)</span> and have units of volts. Like the forces that add movement to a harmonic system, these electromotive forces add charge to a circuit. Matching up most directly with the harmonic system, the electromotive force should be the non-homogeneous function in a non-homogeneous DE.</p></li>
<li><p>To give a complete account of the units, charge is written <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(q\)</span> and measured in coloumbs. The movement of charge is current, represented by the derivative <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(\frac{dq}{dt}\text{.}\)</span> The SOCCLDE that models an alternating current is<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
L \frac{d^2 q}{dt^2} + R \frac{dq}{dt} + \frac{1}{c} q = E(t)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>If there is no resistance and no electromotive force, the solution is sinusoidal oscillation as before (hence <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">alternating</em> current). Under resistance, where there is energy leaving the system, I expect damped oscillations.</p></li>
