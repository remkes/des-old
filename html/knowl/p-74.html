<p>This example leads me to an important question: what do I actually mean by ‘solving a differential equation’? The naivë understanding of solving answers something like this: find a function among the functions I know that fits the equation. Indeed, this is how I talked about solving in <a href="section-what-is-a-de.html#subsection-first-definitions" class="internal" title="Subsection 2.1.1: First Definitions">Subsection 2.1.1</a>. In this sense, most differential equations are ‘unsolvable’. However, after the discussion of this section, I can give a new understanding of ‘solving’. To solve a differential equation is to describe the function that fits the equation. In this sense, the situation is much more optimistic: almost any differential equation I can write down will have a solution, in this sense. However, the difficulty is now in describing the function. There is no guarantee that the function is one that I already know. It might be something completely new. How do I investigate its properties, graph it, understand its behaviour?</p>
