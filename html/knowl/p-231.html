<p>The second major interpretations of SOCCLDEs is as alternating current circuits. The DE that will result is exactly the same, but the interpretation of each of the coefficients is quite different. Instead of a position function \(x(t)\text{,}\) we will have a charge function \(q(t)\) and the movement of that charge will constitute current. For our purposes, we will have four components to a circuit: resistors, capacitors, inductors and an external electro-motive force. Let's quickly given an account.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Resistors allow for energy leaving the system and they represent the resistance to energy flow. The resistance is written \(R\) and measured in ohms. They act like friction in the mechanical system in that they want to slow down the flow of current. They will result in a decrease in current over time if there is no external forcing. Resistors represent the devices powered by the circuit, whatever those devices are.</p></li>
<li><p>Capacitors are storage devices for electrical energy in electric fields. They have a measurement \(c\) called capacitance, which has units of farads (coloumbs per volt). They stabilize alternating current flow; as such, they can be see as controlling the natural way in which current flows. They (up to a reciprocal) align with the spring constant, which controlled the natural behaviour of the harmonic system (before friction and external forces).</p></li>
<li><p>Inductors are storage devices for electrical energy in a magnetic field. They have a measurement \(L\) called inductance, which has units of henrys. Inductors block alternating current; as such, they represent the difficulty of moving charge through the system. In the harmonic system, the difficult of moving the object was its mass. Inductance takes the place of the mass term.</p></li>
<li><p>Electromotive forces are external forces to the system, from batteries or generators. They are written \(E(t)\) and have units of volts. Like the forces that add movement to a harmonic system, these electromotive forces add charge to a circuit.</p></li>
<li>
<p>To give a complete account of the units, charge is written \(q\) and measured in coloumbs. The movement of charge is current, represented by the derivative \(\frac{dq}{dt}\text{.}\)</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
L \frac{d^2 q}{dt^2} + R \frac{dq}{dt} + \frac{1}{c} q = E(t)
\end{equation*}
