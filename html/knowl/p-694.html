<p>In this case, seperation of variables when \(\alpha = 0\) implies that \(X(x)\) must be a linear function. Matching the boundary contions (with a rod of length \(\pi\)) means that \(X(x) = \frac{B-A}{\pi}x + A\text{.}\) This is called the steady-state solution and it is the base case of the situation. (For the previous case with zero boundary conditions, the steady state solution was just \(X(x) = 0\text{.}\)) The steady-state solution is the solution to which we want the situaiton to diffuse; it is the resting case. With non-equal boundary conditions, the steady state involves a heat flow along the rod, from the warmer end to the cooler. A complicated initial heat-situation will diffuse and reduce to a straight-line distribution between the tempeartures at each end as show in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/figure-diffusion1.html" title="Figure 7.3.1">FigureÂ 7.3.1</a>.</p>
