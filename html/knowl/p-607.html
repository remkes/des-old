<p>In this case, the nullclines are \(y = \frac{1}{6}x\) and \(y = \frac{2}{9}x\text{.}\) The steady state is a stable focus. The solutions are all decay terms, so they all tend to the steady state. This doesn't really match the expected behaviour, which looks like rotation. This is an interesting example: the repeated factor leads to the \(t e^{-3t}\) terms, which do have more spinning motion that the general exponential terms. This is like the critically damped case for harmonic motion: it is very close to sinusoidal behaviour but not quite there. It would be very easy to interpret the trajectories as rotational; in this case, the qualitative analysis is misleading. <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/figure-linear-system4.html" title="Figure 6.3.7">FigureÂ 6.3.7</a> shows the nullclines and directions.</p>
