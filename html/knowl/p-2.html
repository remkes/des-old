<li><p><a href="chapter-prelim.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 1: Preliminaries">Chapter 1</a> is an introductory section to remind you of some definition and standardize some notation. This section is not covered by the activities and will not be part of the work during class. It's just there fore your reference and review.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="chapter-first-order-odes.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 2: First Order DEs">Chapter 2</a> is the study of first order ordinary differential equations. These are the most accessiable kind of DE, making them a natural starting place. Even though they are the starting point, they include important equations for application, such as the population equation (which also describes radioactive decay, heat dissipation, and a number of other common natural processes.) This section sets the ground work for the rest of the course and includes many of the core definitions.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="chapter-second-order-odes.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 3: Second Order DEs">Chapter 3</a> is the study of second order ordinary differential equations. Going to second order equations means that I can address acceleration (which is a second derivative). The motivating example is harmonic oscillation: from simple springs and pendulums to more complicated applictions inlcuding friction and damping. Second order ODEs are important and central enough that the the next two chapers are mostly specific techniques for sovling this type of equations.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="chapter-series-solutions.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 4: Series Solutions">Chapter 4</a> is the first of two specialized techniques for solving second order ODEs. It uses the taylor series to express a function as an infinite series. In this form, there are special techniques to understand and calculation which infinite series is the solution to the equation.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="chapter-laplace-transforms.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 5: Laplace Transforms">Chapter 5</a> is the second of two specialized techniques for solving second order ODEs. This is a much strange technique than series solutions. I introduce the Laplace transform, which is a way of changing functions into other functions. This transform allows differential equations to be re-interpreted as algebraic equations. This is obviously very powerful, since solving algebraic equations is much more approachable.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="chapter-systems.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 6: Systems of Differential Equations">Chapter 6</a> introduces solving a system of more than one differential equations. This chapter mostly relies on a qualitative analysis of systems of two equations, but already that leads into useful and interesting applications.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="chapter-pdes.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 7: Partial Differential Equations">Chapter 7</a> is a brief introduction to partial differential equations. I'll really just focus on two equations, but they are two very important equations: the heat equation and the wave equations. The point of this chapter is to give a flavour and idea for the wide world of solving partial differential equations.</p></li>
