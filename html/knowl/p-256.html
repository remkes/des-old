<p>The idea of undetermined coefficients is based on the assumption that the forcing term is likely to dominate the system, so eventually the behaviour of the system should mimic the forcing term. Therefore, the particular solution should be the same type of function as the forcing term. If the forcing is polynomial, I look for a polynomial solution; if the forcing is exponential, I look for an exponential solution; and if the foring is sinusoidal, I look for a sinusoidal solution. Undertermined coefficients is going to work well for these three types of forcing terms or forcing terms given by products of functions of these types. However, it doesn't apply to other types of functions, where I can't reasonably expect the solution to look like the forcing term.</p>
