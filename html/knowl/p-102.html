<p>I've given the definition of stability for first order autonomous DEs. However, the concept of stability has much broader applications to a variety of differential equations (and particularly to systems of differential equations). I am not going to give a formal definition, but the general idea is the same. More complicated DEs and systems of DEs can also have steady states. They are stable, or attractors, if nearby initial values tend towards the steady steady state. They are unstable, or repellors, if neary initial values tend away from the steady states. In more complicated systems, all kinds of intermediate or partially stable behaviours are also possible. <a href="chapter-systems.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 6: Systems of Differential Equations">ChapterÂ 6</a> will investigate some of the interesting intermediate behaviours for systems of two linear DEs.</p>
