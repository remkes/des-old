<p>Now that I have described the two most important interpretations, I need to move on to actually solving SOCCLDEs. I'll make heavy use of the differential operator notation, so let me remind you of the general form of the second order constant coefficient operator.</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
L = a \frac{d^2}{dt^2} + b \frac{d}{dt} + c\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Then the DE that I am trying to solve is</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
Ly = f(t) 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">for some (probably continuous) <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(f(t)\text{.}\)</span> How do I even start? One common strategy in DEs is to look at easier but similar equations and see if the type of solutions from the easier case can extend. The easier case, here, is first-order linear equations. In particular, the homogeneous constant-coefficient first order case, <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(\frac{dy}{dt} = \alpha y\text{,}\)</span> is just the standard percentage growth equation. The solution is an exponential function <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(y = e^{\alpha t}\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, I'm going to guess that exponential functions might also solve the second-order case, at least for homogeneous equations. I will simply assume that the solution to <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(Ly =0\)</span> has the form <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(y = e^{r t}\)</span> for some <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(r \in \RR\text{.}\)</span> If there is such a solution, what must <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(r\)</span> be?  To find out, I'll put the assumed formed into the DE and investigate. This is also a common strategy for DEs: assume (hopefully with some justification) that the solution must have a particular form, then put that form into the differential equation and see what the details must be.</p>
