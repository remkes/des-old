<p>Is this a good solution? It's not the easiest to work with, since it is expressed as an infinite series (and not even a Taylor series). But it does measure the behaviour. The square wave introduces a new force every two units of time. The infinite series is simply capturing the collective effect of all those forces on the system. All the terms are exponential decay, so the system is still trying to decay to equilibrium, but it keeps getting pulled up again. I could analyze the series more carefully to determine the net effect: whether this function is actually growing and at what rate due to the forces.</p>
