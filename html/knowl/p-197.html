<p>The third and final technique we will study for first order DEs is substitution. At some level, solving DEs is a more complicated and involved version of doing integrals, since we are trying to undo the results of differentiation. Substitution is the most common and important technique for solving integrals. It takes complicated integrals and changes their setup to make them more approachable. The technique is exactly the same here: we change the DE with some substitution operation to turn it into something we already know how to do. As with substitution for integrals, we can recognize some typical forms, but many others require creativity and ingenuity to solve. In this section, we'll introduce two forms which use substitution.</p>
