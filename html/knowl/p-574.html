<p>The coefficients \(a,b,c\) and \(d\) are all positive coefficients. \(a\) is a natural birth rate for the prey, \(b\) is the death of prey due to predation, \(c\) is the growth rate of predators due to predation, and \(d\) is the natural death rate of predators. The product \(pq\) represents the number of interactions between predators and prey. The Lokta-Volterra system is a classic system in mathematical biology; however, its non-linearity makes it difficult to solve and the solutions are not expressible by elementary functions. To help understanding the system without having to actually calculate difficult solutions, we will develop qualitative methods of analysis.</p>
