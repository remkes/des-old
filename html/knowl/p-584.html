<p>The qualititative analysis takes place in the plane, which we call the phase-plane. The axes are the values of the functions \(p\) and \(q\text{,}\) so that an isolated point represents a starting value for \(p\) and \(q\text{.}\) We would like to identify the steady states, look at the trajectories, and analyze the stability of the steady states. We lay out the process.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Draw the locus \(f = 0\) (this is called the <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">nullcline</em> of f). Do likewise for \(g\) (the nullcline of \(g\)). Label where \(f&gt;0\) and \(f\lt 0\) on either side of the nullcines, and likewise for \(g\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>The steady states exists at the intersections of the nullclines, where for \(f\) and \(g\) are zero.</p></li>
<li><p>Regions where \(f&gt;0\) and \(g&gt;0\) have growth in both variables. Label these with an arrow pointing up and right. Do likewise for the other three cases: \(f&gt;0\) and \(g\lt 0\) has an arrow pointing up and left; \(f\lt 0\) and \(g&gt;0\) has an arrow pointing down and right; and \(f\lt 0\) and \(g\lt 0\) has an arrow pointing down and left.</p></li>
<li><p>On the nullclines of \(f\) away from the steady states, use the value of \(g\) to determine the movement along the nullclines and label that with an arrow. Do the same for the nullclines of \(g\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>The solution trajectories are paths in the plane which roughly follow the arrows.</p></li>
