<p>We want to know the stability of the steady states in the model. Recall for phase-linea analysis that the stability of the steady states was a relatively simple situation. There were only three cases: stable, unstable, and stable only from one side. For the phase-plane, there are many different behaviours for steady states. However, there are six frequent behaviours of steady states which we classify in the following list.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>The steady state can be entirely attractive, where all the nearby trajectories tend towards the steady state. If the trajectories tend towards the steady state with relatively little rotation, this is called a stable focus.</p></li>
<li><p>The steady state can be entirevly repulsive, where all the nearby trajectories tend away from the steady state. If the trajetories tend directly away from the steady state with relatively little rotation, this is called an unstable focus.</p></li>
<li><p>The steady state can be partially stable, where there is an axis which is attractive and an axis which is respulsive. This is called a saddle point.</p></li>
<li><p>If the steady state is entirely attractive but the trajectories spiral inwards, then the steady state is a stable node.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, if the steady state is entirely repulsive and the trajectories spiral outwards, then the state state is an unstable node.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the steady state can be neither attracitve of repuslive and the nearby trajectories simply form periodic loops around the steady state. This is called a centre.</p></li>
