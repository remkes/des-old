<p>The idea of undetermined coefficients is relatively simple: we try to guess a particular solution which is the same type of function as the forcing. If the forcing is polynomial, we look for a polynomial solution; if the forcing is exponential, we look for an exponential solution; and if the foring is sinusoidal, we look for a sinusoidal solution. Undertermined coefficients is going to work well for these three types of forcing terms or forcing terms given by products of functions of these types. However, it doesn't apply to other types of functions, where we can't reasonably expect the solution to look like the forcing term.</p>
