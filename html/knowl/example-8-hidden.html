<p>The curve \(x^2 + y^2 = c\) solves this equation implicitly. I could break this up into two functions, but its much more natural to leave it as an implicit locus, in this case, a circle. This is very typical: often solutions are left in an implicit form as loci, even though in theory I always look for solutions which are functions \(y =
f(x)\text{.}\) Also notice in this example that only non-negative \(c\) values are allowed in this family of solutions. There is no guarantee that all values of a parameter will lead to reasonable solutions.</p></article></body>
