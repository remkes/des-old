<p>We start with a classic example.</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
y^{\prime\prime} - y= 0
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The characteristic equation is is \(r^2 -1=0\) which has roots \(r = \pm 1\text{.}\) The solutions are \(y=e^t\) and \(y=e^{-t}\text{.}\) The general solution is \(y=Ae^t + Be^{-t}\text{.}\) If we have initial conditions of \(y(0) = 1\) and \(y^\prime(0) = 0\) then we get a system of equations for \(A\) and \(B\text{:}\) \(A+B=1\) and \(A-B=0\text{,}\) which is solved by \(A = B = \frac{1}{2}\text{.}\) The final solution is \(\frac{1}{2} e^t + \frac{1}{2} e^{-t}\text{.}\) We should notice that this is just \(\cosh t\text{,}\) and then realize that we should have predicted this solution. The DE asks: what function returns to itself after two derivatives? Only the hyperbolics have this behaviour.</p>
<p>We could have made different choices for the initial linearly independent solutions by taking \(y_1 = \cosh t\) and \(y_2 = \sinh t\text{.}\) The linearily independent solutions are not unique. For those who know linear algebra, these functions form a basis for the space of solutions and it is well known that a linear space has many different bases.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="constant-coefficients.html#example-32">in-context</a></span>
