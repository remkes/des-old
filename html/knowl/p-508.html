<p>This leads to the amazing use of Laplace transforms in solving DEs. A Laplace transform change differentiation into simple algebraic operations; therefore, it should change some DEs into algebraic equations. Since algebraic equations are much easier to solve than DEs, this is a huge advantage. However, we have one problem. If we want to solve a DE, we want to solve it in the \(t\)-domain. We can transform to the \(s\)-domain and solve the algebraic equation, but we need to get back to the \(t\)-domain to finish. For this, we need to invert the transform, which we will defined in the next section.</p>
