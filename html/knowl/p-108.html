<p>For now, there isn't much more I will do with this linearization. However, it is worth introducing here as a theme since it is so central to applied mathematics. Linear equations are almost always the first kind of DE that applied mathematicians try to use, typically since they have elegant and accessible solutions. Everything else gets simply referred to a ‘non-linear’; in many ways, ‘non-linear’ is a synonmy for annoying and complicated. However, linear models only go so far and often the non-linearity holds the key to understanding a model. Even so, I often want to understand the linear part first and then figure out how to add in the non-linearity in a reasonable fashion to add subtlety to a model.</p>
