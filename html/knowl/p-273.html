<p>Undetermined coefficients is an effective and relatively efficient way to solve for a particular non-homogeneous solution of a SOLCCDE. Its limitation is its scope: it only works for specific forcing terms. Variation of parameters is a much more general method of finding particular solutions. Its weakness is the reliance on difficult integrals â€” often I'll have to leave the solutions in a form which involves unfinished integrals. In the examples, I'll often stick to forcing terms which could have used undetermined coefficients, just to make the integrals reasonable.</p>
