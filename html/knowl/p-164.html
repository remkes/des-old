<p>I should make a couple of notes about this calculation.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>We are informal with the constant. When we take exponents of each side of the equation, we should have multiplication by \(e^c\text{.}\) However, since this is still an undetermined constant, we simply write \(c\) instead of \(e^c\text{.}\) Also, when we drop the absolute value bars from \(y\text{,}\) we should have a \(\pm\) term. Again, since \(c\) can be either positive or negative, we don't worry about that \(\pm\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>We had a \(y\) in the denominator for this process, which means that we have to be careful at points where \(y=0\text{.}\) We use limits to figure out behaviour when \(y\) gets close to zero.</p></li>
<li><p>If \(P\) is constant, this is our most basic exponential equation with solution \(y = ce^{-\alpha t}\text{.}\)</p></li>
