<p>The initial condition determines the situation at the starting time.  However, I also need to control the behaviour of position.  For position, instead of initial conditions, there are boundary conditions.  These describe the behaviour of the system at its boundaries.  For the heat equation on a rod, the domain is <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(x\in [0,\pi]\text{,}\)</span> so the boundary contitions are determination of <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(u(0,t)\)</span> and <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(u(\pi,t)\text{.}\)</span>  These themselves can be functions of <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span>  However, for present purposes, I'll set the boundary contitions to be constant.  If I set the units of temperature reasonably, I can scale so that the boundary conditions are  <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(u(0,t) = u(\pi,t) = 0\text{.}\)</span>  These boundary conditions mean that there is a constant temperature at both ends of the rod at all moments in time. (In physical terms, there are perfect instantaneous heat-sinks at each end of the rod which equalize it to the ambient temperature of zero).</p>
