<p>Mathematical biology only gets more complex and involved from here. The following link shows the system of DEs in the 2004 Molecular Biology of the Cell Paper <a class="external" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC491841/table/tbl1/" target="_blank">“Integrative Analysis of Cell Cycle Control in Budding Yeast” by K.C. Chen et. al.</a> This table is already pretty complicated, with many linear differential equation. In systems biology, this is only the start. A more complete model of cellular reactions can involve hundreds or thousands of coupled differential equations. These models are almost exclusively linear, simply because systems of this size aren't at all approachable if they are not linear. The actualy cellular interactions are most likely non-linear, and these models, as complex as they are, remain at best linear approximations of even more complicated situations.</p>
