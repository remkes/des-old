<p>In general, mathematicians have a practice of being somewhat careless with this constant. Since it doesn't need to be determined until we use an initial condition, we often forgoe various operations on the constant. For example, if we had \(2(t+c)\text{,}\) we would often simplify this to \(2t+c\text{,}\) since whether we figure out the constant from \(c\) or from \(2c\) later, its value is still determined by the initial condition. It's useful to become accustomed to this carelessness constants of integration.</p>
