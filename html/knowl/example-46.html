</h4>
<p>I'll start with a simple and known DE, to see how the method works.</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
y^{\prime \prime} + y = 0
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Both <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> are constant, so they analytic everywhere, even in <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(\CC\text{.}\)</span> Since there are no singular points, I expect solutions which have Taylor series defined for all of <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(\RR\text{.}\)</span> I can centre them at <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(0\)</span> for convenience. I assume the solution has a Taylor series.</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
y = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n t^n
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">I put this into the DE and calcluate, keeping in mind the tools to manipulate the inidices of series.</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
y \amp = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n t^n\\
y^\prime \amp = \sum_{n=1}^\infty c_n nt^{n-1}\\
y^{\prime\prime} \amp = \sum_{n=2}^\infty c_n
n(n-1)t^{n-2}\\
y^{\prime \prime} + y \amp = \sum_{n=2}^\infty c_n
n(n-1)t^{n-2} + \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n t^n  = 0
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Now the DE has become an equation of infinite series. To solve this equation, I would like to express is as a single series. To do that, I usually will need to manipulate the indices. In this case, I shift the first series by 2 and then combine.</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
y^{\prime \prime} + y \amp = \sum_{n=0}^\infty
c_{n+2}(n+2)(n+1)t^n + \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n t^n = 0\\
\amp = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left[ c_{n+2}(n+2)(n+1) + c_n
\right] t^n = 0
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Now I rewrite this last equation in a slightly different form.</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left[ c_{n+2}(n+2)(n+1) + c_n \right]
t^n = \sum_{n=0}^\infty 0 t^n
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">I've  just written the constant function <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(0\)</span> as a series. Now, two series are only equal is every coefficient is the same. Therefore, I can take this equation and turn it into equations of coefficients. There are infinitely many such equations (one for each natural number), but that's alright, since they have a pattern. For every <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(n \in
\NN\text{,}\)</span> there is a recurrence relation.</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
(n+1)(n+2)c_{n+2} + c_n = 0 \implies c_{n+2} =
\frac{-c_n}{(n+1)(n+2)}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">To find the coefficients of the series that solves this DE, I have to solve this recurrence relation. I've essentially translated the problem: what was a differential equation problem is now a recurrence relation problem. I hope that solving the recurrence relation is easier than the original DE. There are various techniques in other parts of mathematics for solving recurrence relations. However, I am not assuming familiar with those techniques and, in this course, I will take a naive approach and try to solve them by inspection.</p>
<p>Before solving the recurrence relation, I need two starting terms, <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(c_0\)</span> and <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(c_1\text{.}\)</span> This works out very well, since <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(c_0 = y(0)\)</span> and <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(c_1 = y^\prime(0)\text{.}\)</span> The initial seed terms for the recurrence relation are exactly initial conditions for the DE. I can either leave them as variables <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> or set them to specific values.</p>
<p>Now I set <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(c_0 = 1\)</span> and <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(c_1 = 0\text{,}\)</span> which are the initial conditions given in the problem. (If I am not given initial conditions, I can leave these two as unknowns and carry them all they way through the process). Then I use the recurrence relation to calculate some terms. The general process of solving by inspection involves calcaulting the first few terms and trying to simply intuit a pattern in the term.</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
c_0 \amp = 1\\
c_1 \amp = 0\\
c_2 \amp = \frac{-c_0}{(1)(2)} = \frac{-1}{2}\\
c_3 \amp = \frac{-c_1}{(2)(3)} = 0\\
c_4 \amp = \frac{-c_2}{(3)(4)} = \frac{1}{2\cdot 3 \cdot
4}\\
c_5 \amp = \frac{-c_3}{(4)(5)} = 0\\
c_6 \amp = \frac{-c_4}{(5)(6)} = \frac{-1}{2\cdot 3
\cdot 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 }\\
c_7 \amp = \frac{-c_5}{(6)(7)} = 0\\
c_8 \amp = \frac{-c_6}{(7)(8)} = \frac{1}{8!}\\
c_9 \amp = \frac{-c_7}{(8)(9)} = 0
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Having calculated a number of terms, a pattern is becoming clear.</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
c_{2n} \amp = \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n)!}\\
c_{2n+1} \amp = 0
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Only the even terms are non zero. If a series has different behaviour between its even and its odd terms, I use this trick of writing <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\((2n)\)</span> to express the even terms and <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\((2n+1)\)</span> to express the odd terms. Since the odd terms vanish, I can write the resulting series only involving even term.</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
y = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n)!} t^{2n}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">This is exactly the Taylor series for cosine, which makes perfect sense, since cosine solves the original DE and matches the initial conditions I imposed.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="ordinary-points.html#example-46">in-context</a></span>
