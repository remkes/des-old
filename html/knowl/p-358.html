<p>The proof of this theorem relies on another differential equation technique called <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">reduction of order</em>. I've chosen not to cover that technique in this course, but it is good to be aware that it exists. In general, if there is one solution to a second order linear DE, then reduction of order is a method for using that solution to change the second order DE into a first order DE, which can then be solved by first order methods. Let me just state the theorem for you; this can be used to deal with the third case in the Method of Frobenius to find the second linearly independent solution.</p>
