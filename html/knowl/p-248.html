<p>The behaviour is this case exponential. If \(a\text{,}\) \(b\) and \(c\) are positive (as they are in both the major interpretations), then the roots are both negative, which means that both solutions are exponential decay. If we are modelling harmonic motion, the harmonic system decays to equilibrium with no oscillations. The discriminant condition is \(b^2 &gt; 4ac\) and recall that \(b\) was the coefficient of friction. The case of two real roots only happens if \(b\) is large enough. Exponential decay is the behaviour that results from a surplus of friction. There is too much friction even to have oscillations: we only have exponential decay to equilibrium. We called these situations <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">overamped</em> harmonic systems.</p>
