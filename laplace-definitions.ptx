    In functional analysis, there are a group of operations on
    functions called transforms. These operations act on sets of
    functions and transform them into new functions: through the
    transforms, behaviour that was previously hidden can be made
    clear.
  </p>
  <p>
    The changes due to transforms are often radical: the resulting
    functions do not look anything like the originals. I can think
    of transforms as radically altering the environment of the
    function, so that everything changes into a surprisingly different
    form.
  </p>
  <p>
    For those who like to think in linear algebra terms, think
    of the space of functions defined on some interval in <m>\RR</m>
    as a vector space. (The specific vector space depends on the
    interval and the class of function: continuous,
    piecewise-continuous, differentiable, etc). In this language,
    transforms are nothing but interesting linear transformations
    between vector spaces of functions.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this section, I introduce the Laplace transform. It applies to a
    functions with certain controls on their asymptotic growth. I need
    a technical definition.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A function <m>f(t)</m> defined on <m>[0, \infty)</m> is of
        <term>exponential order c</term> if <m>\exists M > 0 \ \
        \exists T > 0</m> such that <m>\forall t > T \ \ \ |f(t)| \lt
        Me^{ct}</m>. Asymptotically, this is equivalent to <m>f \in
        \calO(e^{ct})</m> for some real positive <m>c</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>f(t)</m> is a piecewise-continuous function on <m>[0,
        \infty)</m> of exponential order <m>c</m>, then its
        <term>Laplace transform</term> is the new function in the
        variable <m>s</m> defined by the following integral.
        <me>
          \calL \{ f(t) \} (s) = \int_0^\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt
        </me>.
        The Laplace transform is defined on the domain <m>(c,
        \infty)</m>. (You could check that this improper integral
        converges for all <m>s \in (c, \infty)</m>.)
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    The restriction of exponential order is a fairly reasonable one:
    differential equations in applied mathematics are rarely
    concerned with functions which grow faster than the exponential.
  </p>
  <p>
    The choice of variables is standard for Lapalce transforms. I
    will often refer to the original functions as functions in the
    <m>t</m>-domain, and to their transforms as functions in the
    <m>s</m>-domain. In addition, if <m>f(t)</m> and <m>g(t)</m> are
    function in the <m>t</m>-domain, I will also often write
    <m>F(s)</m> and <m>G(s)</m> for their Laplace transforms. By
    convention, I use lower case for the <m>t</m>-domain and
    uppercase for the matching function in the <m>s</m>-domain. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Most of the following examples are sub-exponential, so I expect a
    transform on <m>(0, \infty)</m>. Note that I am never guaranteed
    convergence at <m>0</m>.

        My first observation about Laplace transforms is simply their
        strangeness. Powers of <m>t</m> turn into inverse powers of
        <m>s</m>, but exponentials (which are very different in the
        <m>t</m> domain) turn into very similar reciprocals.

        Lapalce transforms exist for piecewise-continuous functions
        with a certain exponential order. Here is a piecewise
        continuous function and its transform.

        The Laplace transform is not a piecewise function,
        even thought the original was.

        The Laplace transform of <m>t^n</m> for <m>n \in \ZZ</m>
        involved factorials, so it is not surprising that
        <m>t^\alpha</m> for non-integer <m>\alpha</m> involves the
        extension of the factorial: the <m>\Gamma</m> function.

        Finally, Laplace transforms are defined for some important
        oscillating functions, such as the trigonometric functions and
        the Bessel functions.
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \calL \{ \sin t \} \amp = \int_0^\infty e^{-st} \sin t dt

          <mrow>
            \calL \{ J_0(kt) \} \amp = \frac{1}{\sqrt{s^2 + k^2}}

        Again, note the strangeness: even starting with transcendental
        and non-elementary functions like these, the Lapalce
        transforms are rational and algebraic functions.

    </statement>

    As an aside, the Laplace transform is not the only transform in
    mathematics. The most well-known and well-used transform is the
    Fourier transform.  It uses the same conventions about the
    <m>s</m> and the <m>t</m> domains, but it uses complex valued
    functions and integrals. In place of the <m>e^{-st}</m> term in
    the Laplace transform, the Fourier transform uses the complex
    <m>e^{-2\pi \imath st}</m>.
