        Consider this standard second order linear differential
        operator.
        <me>
          L = \frac{d^2}{dt^2} + P(t) \frac{d}{dt} + Q(t)
        </me>
        Assume that <m>t=0</m> is an ordinary point for this
        differential equation. Write <m>P(t)</m> and <m>Q(t)</m> as
        series with unknown coefficients.
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \amp P(t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty p_n t^n \amp \amp
            Q(t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty q_n t^n 
          </mrow>
        </md>
        Using the process of solving by Taylor series at an ordinary
        point, calculate the coefficients of the solution up to
        <m>c_4</m>. (These coefficients will, of course, depend on the
        coefficients <m>p_i</m> and <m>q_k</m>. The expressions will
        get complicated quite quickly. The point of this exercise is
        to show how quickly the complexity grows then the coefficient
        functions need to be treated as series themselves.) (10) 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Use Taylor series centred at <m>t=0</m> to solved the following
        differential equation. (Make sure you verify that <m>t=0</m>
        is an ordinary point). (6) 
        <me>
          y^{\prime \prime} + 4t^2y = 0 
        </me>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        In the course notes, I solve the equation
        <me>
          y^{\prime \prime} + ty = 0 
        </me>.
        In the previous question, you solved the equation
        <me>
          y^{\prime \prime} + 4t^2y = 0 
        </me>.
        Even though this is only two examples, try to argue for a
        pattern for the solutions to the general equation (for
        <m>\alpha \in \RR</m>, <m>\alpha \neq 0</m> and <m> n \in
        \NN</m>).
        <me>
          y^{\prime \prime} + \alpha t^ny = 0 
        </me>.
        What kind of behaviour do all these solutions display? (4)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Use Taylor series centred at <m>t=0</m> to solve the following
        differential equation with initial values <m>y(0) = 1</m> and
        <m>y^\prime(0) = 0</m>. (Make sure you verify that <m>t=0</m>
        is an ordinary point). What radius do you expect for the
        solution to this differential equation? (8) 
        <me>
          (t^2 - 5t + 6) y^{\prime \prime} + y^\prime + ty = 0 
        </me>
        (You only need to calculate the solution up to the coefficient
        of <m>x^7</m>, since finding a pattern here is pretty
        difficult.)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Determine which real numbers are ordinary points, singular
        points, and regular singular points for this differential
        equation. (4) 
        <me>
          y^{\prime \prime} + \frac{y^\prime}{(t-3)^2(t-4)(t-5)^3} +
          \frac{y}{(t-3)(t-4)^2(t-5)} = 0 
        </me>
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
        Determine which real numbers are ordinary points, singular
        points, and regular singular points for this differential
        equation. (4) 
        <me>
          y^{\prime \prime} + \frac{y^\prime}{\cos t - 1} +
          \frac{y}{\sin t - 1} = 0 
        </me>

        Determine which real numbers are ordinary points, singular
        points, and regular singular points for this differential

        <me>
          y^{\prime \prime} + \frac{y^\prime}{\sqrt{t}} +
          \frac{y}{\sqrt{t^3}} = 0 
        </me>

      <p>
        Consider the following differential equation. (10)
        <me>
          ty^{\prime \prime} + \sinh t y = 0 
        </me>.
        Use the existence theorem for series solutions to prove that
        this DE has a solution centred at <m>t=0</m> with infinite
        radius of convergence. (That is, prove that there are no
        singular points.) Then solve the equation with initial
        conditions <m>y(0) = \alpha</m> and <m>y^\prime(0) = 0</m>
        where <m>a \in \RR</m>. (You only need to calculate the
        coefficients up to <m>t^8</m>, since finding a general
        solution here is very challenging.) 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Solve this differential equation using the Method of Frobenius
        centred at <m>t=0</m>. Find two independent solutions if you
        can; if you can't find one solution and comment on the form of
        the second solution. (8)
        <me>
          3t y^{\prime \prime} + (2-t) y^{\prime} - y = 0
        </me>
