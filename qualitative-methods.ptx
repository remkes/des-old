  <title>Qualitative Methods for First Order DEs</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      As we said before,
      many DEs are very difficult or impossible to solve directly.
      Implicit or qualitative methods try to say something about the solutions without actually finding the solutions.
      Even when we can exactly solve an equation,
      these methods are great for interpreting the behaviour of the solutions.

    <title>Autonomous DEs and Phase-Line Analysis</title>
    <p>
      Consider a population model <m>p(t)</m> with its autonomous DE.
      <me>
        \frac{dp}{dt} = f(p)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a lovely piece of qualitative analysis for autonomous equations called the
      <em>phase line analysis</em>.
      Phase line analysis looks at the right side of the equation and asks:
      what values of <m>p</m> set the right side to zero.
      What does this mean?
      When the right side of our differential equation is 0, the left side is 0 as well.
      The left side is the growth rate,
      so that means the growth rate is zero.
      This is a value of the population <m>p</m> where there is no growth.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          In an autonomous DE, a value of the function where the derivative vanishes is called a
          <term>steady states</term>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      If the population is exactly at its steady state, it will not change;
      steady states are constant populations which do no grow or decline.
      (For population models, we can make the reasonable assumptions that
      <m>p \geq 0</m> and <m>p=0</m> is always a steady state.
      Otherwise, we can have any real values on the phase line.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Once we have the steady states,
      we ask what happens between each steady state.
      Assuming that the DE is reasonable,
      then between the steady states,
      the right side will be either positive or negative.
      When it is positive,
      we have a positive growth rate and the population increases.
      When it is negative,
      we have a negative growth rate and the population decreases.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          In an autonomous DE, the direction of growth negative or positive,
          called the <term>trajectory</term> of the popluation.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Steady states and trajectories give us an remarkably complete understanding of the population.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If the popluation is at a steady state, it doesn't change.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If the popluation is not at a steady state,
            we look at the trajectory.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If the trajectory is positive,
            the popluation grows either to the closest larger steady state or to infinity.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If the trajectory is neagative,
            the population declines either to the closest smaller steady state or to zero.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      We summarize this information is a phase line diagram.
      We take a ray representing
      <m>p \geq 0</m> and put dots on the ray for the steady states.
      In between, we put arrows to show the trajectories.
      Its best to see the phase line diagrams through examples.

      The logistic equation leads to logistic growth.
      We can see from the phase line diagram that the trajectories all point towards the value <m>p=4</m>.
      In logistic growth,
      the values always want to revert to some non-zero steady state.
      From below, this is growth up to some firm maximum.
      After exponential growth,
      logistic growth is the most commonly used model for populations.

        <p>
          The right side factors as <m>p(p-2)(p-5)</m>,

          Those are the steady states.
          When <m>p \in (0,4)</m> the derivative is positive,

    <title>Direction Fields</title>
    <p>
      If the equation is not autonomous,
      then the phase-line is too simple a tool to capture the details.
      However, if we can solve for the derivative,
      we can write a first order DE as
      <me>
        \frac{dy}{dx} = F(x,y)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This allows a very useful interpretation:
      the left side is the slope of a graph,
      the right side is a function on <m>\RR^2</m>,
      giving a value at every point in the plane.
      Together, we determine a slope at every point in the plane.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A determination of a slope at all point in a subset <m>U</m> of <m>RR^2</m> is called a
          <term>direction field</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <figure xml:id="figure-direction-field1">

    </figure>
    <p>
      If there are solutions to the DE, then they must be functions which fit these slopes.
      Therefore, the slopes give us a sense of what the functions look like.
      Let's go back to the simplest example.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <me>
          \frac{dy}{dx} = y
        </me>
        <p>
          The slope at a point <m>(x,y)</m> is <m>y</m>,
          so the slope at <m>(3,4)</m> is <m>4</m>,
          the slope at <m>(-2,-3)</m> is <m>-3</m> and the slope at <m>(32,0)</m> is <m>0</m>.
          <xref ref="figure-direction-field1">Figure</xref> shows the direction field.
        </p>
        <p>
          The solutions exactly fit the direction field.
          Therefore, if we can draw and understand the direction field,
          we get a sense of the solutions.
          Notice that since the direction field fills <m>\RR^2</m>
          (or a portion of it),
          we expect an infinite family of graphs of functions to match all the slopes.
          <xref ref="figure-direction-field1">Figure</xref>
