  <title>Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Before moving on with other techniques for solving first order equations,
      this is a nice place to take a pure-mathematical detour and talk about existence and uniqueness of solutions.
      We're going to deal with first order equations where we can isolate the derivative term,
      that is, equations of the form
      <me>
        \frac{dy}{dx} = F(x,y)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The details of existence and uniqueness theorems rely on the properties of <m>F</m> as a function of two variable.
      In this treatment,
      we think of <m>y</m> and <m>x</m> as two unrelated, independent variables,
      even though the DE itself implies that <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection xml:id="existence">
    <title>Existence</title>
    <p>
      Existence of solutions to first order DES is established by the Peano Existence Theorem.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          In a equation of this form above,
          if <m>F</m> is continuous in both variables in an open set
          <m>U \subset \RR^2</m> and if <m>(x_0,y_0) \in U</m>,
          then there exists <m>\epsilon > 0</m> such that the Initial Value Problem associated to the DE and the initial condition
          <m>y(x_0) = y_0</m> has a solution with domain at least <m>[x_0-\epsilon,x_0+\epsilon]</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      This is a very local result:
      the small positive <m>\epsilon</m> only guarantees a tiny piece of a function as a solution.
      Existence (and later uniqueness) are only guaranteed very close to the initial value of the function.
      We do know that the function is differentiable in this small inteval,
      but we don't know anything else:
      outside the interval, anything could happen with the solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's also useful to note,
      particularly for students with experience in other senior mathematics classes,
      that this theorem relies on topological considerations:
      we need an open subset <m>U</m> where <m>F</m> is continuous.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <me>
          y^\prime = y^{\frac{2}{3}} \hspace{2cm} y(0)=0
        </me>
        <p>
          This satisfies the conditions of the theorem, so a solutions exists.
          However, there are two solutions:
          <m>y=0</m> and <m>y=x^3/27</m>.
          Peano's theorem doesn't imply the uniqueness of a solution.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <me>
          y^\prime = \sqrt{|y|} \hspace{2cm} y(0) = 0
        </me>
        <p>
          This <m>F</m> is also continuous near <m>(0,0)</m>,
          so a solution exists by Peano's theorm.
          This IVP is solved by <m>y=0</m> and <m>y = x^2/4</m>.
          It's obvious that we need something more to ensure uniqueness.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Before we move on to the next result,
      we could ask for the proof of this theorem.
      Unforunately,
      that proof doesn't fall within the scope of this course.
      We would need to establish a number of new definitions and techniques from real analysis,
      as well as struggle through a bunch of tricky
      <m>\epsilon</m> and <m>\delta</m> arguments.
      It's interesting stuff,
      but very challenging and therefore left aside for this course.

  <subsection xml:id="lipschitz">
    <title>Lipschitz Continuity</title>
    <p>
      In order to state the theorem about uniqueness,
      we need a new definition of continuity.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function from an open set <m>U</m> in <m>\RR</m> to <m>\RR</m> is called
          <term>Lipschitz continuous</term>
          if <m>\exists K > 0</m> such that
          <m>\forall x_1,x_2 \in U</m> we have <m>|f(x_1) - f(x_2)| \leq K|x_1-x_2|</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      This is a strange kind of continuity.
      The definition is stronger than normal: Lipschitz continuity implies normal continuity.
      Moreover, the definition is global over <m>U</m>,
      not just local like conventional continuity.
      Therefore, the domain matters:
      a function might be Lipschitz continuous on a small set,
      but not on a larger one.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an interpretation, Lipschitz continuity is a control on the global growth over the designated set.
      For a Lipschitz continuous function,
      there is a linear function that bounds the function on the designated set.
      Unsurprisingly,
      this means that the defintion usually only works on bounded sets.
      As a visualization,
      we can think of the definition as comparing <m>f</m> to a function <m>g(x) = K|x|</m>.
      The graph of <m>g</m> gives a cone in <m>\RR^2</m> and the <m>f</m> must stay inside this cone to be Lipschitz continuous.
      In this way,
      the definition limits the local growth of <m>f</m> and its derivatives.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Here are some examples to illustrate the idea of Lipschitz continuity.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>f(x) = x</m> is Lipschitz continuous for <m>K=1</m> on any interval,
                since it is bounded by itself, a linear function.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>f(x) = x^2</m> is Lipschitz continuous on any
                <em>bounded</em> interval.
                Specifically, on <m>(-7,7)</m> we can take <m>K=14</m>.
                However, <m>f(x) = x^2</m> is not Lipschitz continuous on all of <m>\RR</m>,
                since no linear function bounds it.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>f(x) = x^{\frac{2}{3}}</m> is not Lipschitz continuous on <m>(-1,1)</m>,
                since its slope gets arbitrarily steep near the origin.
                This means that very close to <m>0</m>,
                it cannot be bounded by a linear function through <m>(0,0)</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      The previous example was not Lipschitz continuous at <m>0</m>,
      and it also failed to be differentiable at that point.
      We might wonder if differentiability is a sufficient condition.
      That would be convenient, since we know how to check for differentiability.
      However, consider a strange example.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <me>
          f(X) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} x^{\frac{3}{2}} \sin \left(
          \frac{1}{x} \right) \amp  x \in (0,1] \\ 0 \amp  x = 0 \end{matrix}
          \right.
        </me>
        <p>
          This isn't Lipschitz continuous,
          but it is differentiable near zero,
          showing that differentiability isn't sufficient.
          However, there is some good news:
          this example is a strange aberation.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function which is <m>C^1</m> at a point <m>a</m> in its domain is also Lipschitz continuous at a.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      <m>f \in C^1</m> is roughly equivalent to saying that
      <m>\frac{\del f}{\del y}</m> must exist and be bounded.
      This last criterion is the one we will use in practice:
      we check if the derivatives exists and if it is bounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the <m>f(x) = x^2</m>.
      The derivaitve is <m>2x</m>, which is bounded locally near <m>0</m>.
      <m>f(x) = x^\frac{2}{3}</m> has derivative
      <m>\frac{2}{3} x^{\frac{-1}{3}}</m> which is unbounded near 0.
      The former function is Lipschitz continuous and the later is not.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="uniqueness">
    <title>Uniqueness</title>
    <p>
      The theorem for Uniqueness is called the Picard-Lindel&#xf6;f thereom.
      It is a small improvement and adjustment of the Peano existence theorem.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>F</m> is Lipschitz continuous in y and continuous is x on an open set <m>U</m> in <m>\RR^2</m> and if
          <m>(x_0,y_0) \in U</m> then the initial value problem
          <me>
            \frac{dy}{dx} = F(x,y) \hspace{2cm} y(x_0) = y_0
          </me>
          has a unique solution <m>y=f(x)</m> defined on the domain
          <m>[x_0-\epsilon,x_0+\epsilon]</m> for some <m>\epsilon > 0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      All of the comments from the previous theorem apply here.
      The result is very local,
      relies on topology, and the proof is beyond the scope of the course.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <me>
          \frac{dy}{dx} = x \sqrt{y}
        </me>
        <p>
          We considered this differential equation earlier.
          It had multiple solutions for initial value <m>y(0) = 0</m>.
          The function <m>F(x,y) = x\sqrt{y}</m> has <m>y</m> deriavtive <m>\frac{\del F}{\del y} = \frac{x}{2\sqrt{y}}</m>,
          which is unbounded near <m>0</m>.
          Therefore, it is not Lipschitz continuous and doesn't satisfy the continious of the Picard-Lidenl&#xf6;f theorem,
          meaning that we don't expect a unique solution.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Lastly, anticipating the next section,
      consider the general first-order linear DE where <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are continuous functions.
      <me>
        \frac{dy}{dx} = Q(x) - P(x) y
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case,
      <m>F(x,y) = Q(x) - P(x)y</m> and the <m>y</m> derivative is <m>-P(x)</m>,
      which is bounded assuming that <m>F</m> is continuous.
      We can then apply the Picard-Lindel&#xf6;f theorem to conclude that linear equations have unique solutions whenever their coefficient functions <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are continuous.
