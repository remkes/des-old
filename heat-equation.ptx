  <title>The Heat Equation</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In our very short investigation of PDEs, we will look at two equations.
      The first is the heat equation.
      It concerns a function <m>u(x,t)</m> which depends on position and time.
      <m>u(x,t)</m> measures the heat in a one-dimensional object
      (usually a rod, rail, wire, stick or something similar).
      The heat varies in position along the object as well as in time.
      We let <m>x \in [0,l]</m> where <m>l</m> is the length of the rod.
      For convenience
      (by choosing appropriate units),
      we will set <m>l = \pi</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question we want to ask is this:
      how does the heat distribution along the rod develop over time?
      What happens to the heat at various positions and times?
      Where does the heat flow, increase, decrease and diffuse?
      The heat equation tries to answer this question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thermodynamics says that heat wants to diffuse.
      Diffusion is the equalizing of differences,
      so the greater the difference in heat,
      the greater the inclination for difussions.
      How do we measure this?
      The measurement must be local,
      since heat cannot jump discontinuously.
      The local description that measures this heat difference is the concavity of the function.
      Moreover, concave down regions want to equalize downward and concave up regions want to equalize upwards,
      as in <xref ref="figure-heat-equation" />.
      Therefore, the heat diffusion should be proportional to the concavity with a positive proportionality constant.
    </p>

          xaxis("$x$");
          yaxis("$u$");

          draw((0,3){E}..{E}(2,5){E}..{E}(4,3){E}..{E}(6,1){E}..{E}(8,3));

          draw((0,3)--(8,3),dashed);

          draw((6,1)--(6,3),Arrow);

          label("Concave down diffuses downard.",(3,5),N);
          label("Concave up diffuses upward.",(6,1),S);
          label("$u(x)$",(4,3),NE);
          label("Equilibrium",(2,3),S);
        </asymptote>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
      We translate these thermodynamic realities into a partial differential equation.
      The second derivative in position measure concavity and the first derivative in time measures the change in heat resulting from the diffusion.
      The above set-up shows that these should be proportional to each other.
      Let <m>k</m> be a positive number.
      <me>
        \frac{\del u}{\del t} = k \frac{\del^2 u}{\del x^2}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is called the heat equation.
      Though we've defined it by talking about heat,
      it is a very general equation and applies to any system that involves diffusion.
      It is sometimes also called the diffusion equation.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection xml:id="initial-boundary-conditions">
    <title>Initial and Boundary Conditions</title>
    <p>
      With ordinary differential equations,
      we needed initial conditions to get a particular solution.
      The same it true with PDEs, but the initial assumptions are more complicated.
      At a specific time, say <m>t=0</m>,
      the function <m>u(x,0)</m> is still a function of <m>x</m>.
      Our initial condition, then, is an entire function:
      <m>u(x,0) = f(x)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The initial condition determines the situation at the starting time.
      However, we also need to control the behaviour of position.
      For position, instead of initial conditions,
      we have boundary conditions.
      These tell us the behaviour of the system at its boundaries.
      For the heat equation on a rod,
      we have <m>x\in [0,\pi]</m>,
      so the boundary contitions are determination of <m>u(0,t)</m> and <m>u(\pi,t)</m>.
      These themselves can be functions of <m>t</m>.
      However, for our purposes, we'll set the boundary contitions to be constant.
      If we set the units of temperature reasonably,
      we can have <m>u(0,t) = u(\pi,t) = 0</m>.
      These boundary condition mean that we have a constant temperature at both ends of the rod at all moments in time. (In physical terms,
      there are perfect instantaneous heat-sinks at each end of the rod which equalize it to the ambient temperature of zero).

    <title>Solving the Heat Equation</title>
    <p>
      The method of approach we use to solve the equation is a common one for PDE and is called
      <em>seperation of variables</em>.
      We make the assumption
      (eventually justified!)
      that we can pull apart the two variables,
      <m>x</m> and <m>t</m>, and deal with the seperately.
      We assume that <m>u</m> is a product of two single variables functions.
      <me>
        u(x,t) = T(t) X(x)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like all of our assumptions about DEs, we simply put this back into the equation.
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{\del^2 u}{\del x^2} \amp = X^{\prime \prime}(x) T(t)</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{\del u}{\del t} \amp = T^{\prime}(t) X(x)</mrow>
        <mrow>k X^{\prime \prime} T(t) \amp = X(t) T^\prime(t)</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{X^{\prime \prime}(x)}{X(x)} \amp = \frac{1}{k} \frac{T^\prime(t)}{T(t)}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      We bring all the terms involving <m>x</m> to one side and all those involving <m>t</m> to the other.
      Since the left is equal to the right and they involve different variables,
      both sides must be constant.
      Let's call this constant <m>\alpha</m>.
      This completes the seperation of variables,
      giving us two ordinary differential equations.
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{X^{\prime \prime}(x)}{X(x)} \amp = \alpha</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{1}{k} \frac{T^\prime(t)}{T(t)} \amp = \alpha</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, to solve the heat equation with seperation of variables,
      we solve these two ODEs seperately.
      The <m>T</m> solutions are easy.
      <me>
        T^\prime(t) = \alpha k T(t) \implies T(t) = T(0) e^{\alpha kt}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We have written the initial constant as <m>T(0)</m>.
      The time function is just exponential growth/decay,
      but <m>X</m> solutions depend more carefully on the boundary conditions.

    <p>
      The <m>X</m> equation is a second order linear equation:
      <m>X^{\prime \prime}(x) - \alpha X(x) = 0</m>.
      If <m>\alpha > 0</m> then we expect exponential solutions <m>X(x) = c_1 e^{\alpha x} + c_2e^{\alpha x}</m>.
      However, the boundary conditions apply.
      <m>X(0) = X(\pi) = 0</m> implies that <m>c_1 = c_2 = 0</m>;
      the only solution here is the trivial solution <m>X(x) = 0</m>.
      Therefore, to get solutions that actually mean somthing,
      <m>\alpha</m> cannot be positive.
      If <m>\alpha = 0</m> then we get <m>X = Ax + B</m>.
      Again, the boundary conditions give <m>A=B=0</m>,
      so we only get the zero solution.
      Therefore, only <m>\alpha \lt 0</m> gives interesting solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      (This <m>\alpha \lt 0</m> also effects the <m>T</m> solutions,
      which relied on the same <m>\alpha</m>.
      The fact that <m>\alpha \lt 0</m> means that the <m>T</m> solutions must be decaying exponentials instead of growing exponentials.
      This is physically expected, since over time the heat should diffuse.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>\alpha = -n^2</m> for <m>n > 0</m> a real number.
      From our study of second order linear equations, the solutions are
      <me>
        X(x) = A \cos nx + B \sin nx
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, we go back to the boundary conditions.
      <m>X(0) = 0</m> implies <m>A=0</m>,
      so we are left with <m>X(x) = B \sin nx</m>.
      Then <m>X(\pi) = 0</m> implies
      <m>B \sin n\pi = 0</m> which is only satisfied if <m>n \in \NN</m>.
      In conclusion,
      matching the boundary conditions means that the only possible <m>X</m> solutions are <m>X(x) = B \sin nx</m> for <m>n \in \NN</m>
      (and the zero solution).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we put the solutions together.
      <me>
        u(x,t) = T(0) e^{-n^2kt} \sin (nx)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      In these solutions, we see sine waves decaying over time.
      The integer <m>n</m> gives the number of osscilations of the wave in on the rod,
      and the exponential terms give a decay in amplitude over time.
      <xref ref="figure-seperable-solution1" />
      shows the decay of a simple sine wave with <m>n=5</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we consider the initial condition <m>u(x,0) = f(x)</m>.
      For each <m>n</m>,
      the seperable solution is a sine wave <m>\sin (nx)</m>.
      This is great if <m>f(x)</m> happened to be such a sine wave,
      but we would like the theory to work with more general initial conditions.
      The key observation here is that the heat equation is linear:
      if we have two solutions to the heat equation,
      their sum is also a solution.
      Therefore, we could add up these seperable solutions.
      For example, a possible solution could be
      <me>
        u(x,t) = 4e^{-9kt} \sin 3t + 6e^{-25kt} \sin 5t
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This isn't strictly seperable anymore,
      but it is the sum of seperable pieces.
      (This justifies the original assumption!
      We don't get all possibility as seperable solutions,
      but we will get all reasonable solutions as the <em>sum</em>
      of various seperable pieces.)
      The initial value <m>u(x,0)</m> also isn't a simple sine wave anymore,
      since it is the function <m>f(x) = 4\sin 3t + .6 \sin 5t</m>.
      <xref ref="figure-seperable-solution2" />
      shows the decay of this initial condition.

    </figure>
    <p>
      In theory, we could add any number of the seperable solutions together.
      Therefore, in full generality,
      a solution could look like an arbitrary sum.
      <me>
        u(x,t) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty T_n(0) e^{-n^2kt} \sin (nx)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a series solution,
      but the series has <m>\sin nx</m> instead of <m>x^n</m> as the series terms.
      We try to match our initial condition <m>u(x,0) = f(x)</m> with this series.
      <me>
        u(x,0) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty T_n(0) \sin (nx) = f(x)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      As long as we can find coefficients <m>T_n(0)</m> that make this series work,
      we can solve the heat equation.
      That leads to this question:
      which functions <m>f(x)</m> can be expressed as a series in <m>\sin (nx)</m> in this way?
      Once we know that, we can have a full,
      general solution to the heat equation
      (with constant zero boundary conditions).
