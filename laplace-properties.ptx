          The Laplace transform (like all reasonable operations in
          analysis) is linear.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \calL \{ f+ g \} \amp = \calL \{ f \} + \calL \{ g \}
            </mrow>
            <mrow>\
              \calL \{ c f(t)\} \amp = c \calL \{ f \}
            </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      As I will demonstrate, the Laplace transform is not
      multiplicative. There is no good, general way to deal with 
      (<m>\calL \{ fg \}</m>), though particular product have
      identities which I will show later. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, the asymptotic order of <m>f</m> was important to
      allowing the definition of the Laplace transform. However, all
      the transforms I've shown so far produce decaying functions. This
      is a general statment: for any function <m>f(t)</m> of
      exponential order <m>c > 0</m>, it is true that
      <me>
        \lim_{s \rightarrow \infty} \calL \{ f(t) \} (s) = 0
      </me>.
      This property is a useful check: if you ever get a Laplace
      transform which doesn't have this limit, you've made a mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      For same students who like linear algebra, I can use linear
      algebra language to describe the Laplace transform. Let
      <m>EOF(0,\infty)</m> be the space of piecewise-continuous
      functions of exponential order defined on <m>(0, \infty)</m>
      (<m>EOF</m> for exponential order functions). Let <m>DF^+</m>
      be the set of continuous functions which are defined on <m>(a,
      \infty)</m> for some <m>a > 0</m> and have limit <m>0</m> as
      <m>s \rightarrow \infty</m> (DF for decay functions). These are
      both linear spaces, since addition, subtraction and
      multiplication by constants preserve the properties of
      definition. The the Laplace transform is a linear
      transformation between these vector spaces.

        \calL : EOF(0,\infty) \rightarrow DF^+

      One of the product that does work well for Laplace transforms is
      multiplication by exponential functions.

    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \calL \{ e^{at} f(t) \} (s) \amp = \int_0^\infty e^{at}
              f(t) e^{-st} dt
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \int_0^\infty f(t) e^{at-st} dt = \int_0^\infty
              f(t) e^{(a-s)t} dt
            </mrow>
            <mrow>

          Multiplication by <m>e^{at}</m> in the <m>t</m> domain
          results in a shift by <m>a</m> in the <m>s</m> domain. This
          also adjust the domain of <m>s</m>, reflected the fact that
          multiplication by <m>e^{at}</m> adjusts the exponential
          order.

      Shifts are quite important in the whole theory.  What happens
      when the shift is in the <m>t</m> domain?
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>unit step function</term> <m>u_a(t)</m> is a
          piecewise function defined as follows. 
          <me>
            u_a(t) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} 0 \amp t \lt  a \\ 1 \amp
            t \geq a. \end{matrix} \right.
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The unit step function multiplied by some other function
      (<m>u_a(t) f(t)</m>) cancels any part of
      <m>f</m> for <m>t\lt a</m>, but preserves <m>f</m> for <m>t \geq
      a</m>. To define a shift of <m>f</m>, I can write <m>u_a(t)
      f(t-a)</m> to remove anything before <m>t=0</m> from <m>f</m>.
      (Remember that piecewise continuous functions work with
      Laplace transforms.) I calculate to find the result of this
      shift in the <m>t</m>-domain.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \calL \{ u_a(t) \} (s) \amp = \int_0^\infty u_a(t) e^{-st}
          dt = \int_a^\infty e^{-st} dt
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp = \left. \frac{-e^{-st}}{s} \right|_a^\infty =
          \frac{e^{-as}}{s}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \calL \{ u_a (t) f(t-a)\} (s) \amp = \int_a^\infty e^{-st}
          f(t-a) dt
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          v \amp = t-a
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp = \int_0^\infty e^{-s(v+a)} f(v) dv = e^{-sa}
          \int_0^\infty e^{-sv} f(v) dv
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \amp = e^{-sa} \calL \{ f(t) \} (s) = e^{-sa} F(s)
        </mrow>

      There is a nice parallel here, though it's not a perfect
      symmetry. Shifts in one domain correspond to multiplication by
      exponentials in the other domain.
