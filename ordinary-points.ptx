    <p>
      Consider a homogeneous linear second order differential
      equation.
      <me>
        y^{\prime \prime} + P(t) y^\prime + Q(t) y= 0
      </me>
      In a departure from the <xref ref="chapter-second-order-odes"
      />, we will now allow <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> to be functions
      instead of just constants. Before we jump into the method of
      series solutions, we need some theory about the existence of
      solutions.

        <p>
          A point <m>\alpha</m> is called an <term>ordinary
          point</term> for the differential equation if <m>P</m> and
          <m>Q</m> are both analytic at <m>\alpha</m>. Otherwise it
          is called a <term>singular point</term>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>\alpha</m> is an ordinary point of a linear
          homogeneous second order differential equation, the there
          exists two linearly independent analytic solutions centered
          at <m>\alpha</m>. These analytic solutions will have radii
          of convergence at least as large as the distance from
          <m>\alpha</m> to the nearest singular point of the DE.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      This is a lovley theorem, but these is one catch. The
      <sq>distance</sq> mentioned to the nearest singular point is
      actually distance in <m>\CC</m> to a possibly-complex singular
      point. In practice, this isn't too much of a worry, but we
      should be careful with our assumptions about the radii of
      convergence.

    <title>The Method for Solutions at Ordinary Points</title>

        <p>
          Let's start with a simple and known DE, to see how the
          method works.
          <me>
            y^{\prime \prime} + y = 0
          </me>
          Both <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are constant, so they analytic
          everywhere, even in <m>\CC</m>. Since there are no singular
          points, we expect solutions which have Taylor series defined
          for all of <m>\RR</m>. We can centre them at <m>0</m> for
          convenience. We assume the solution has a Taylor series.
          <me>
            y = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n t^n
          </me>
          We put this into the DE and calcluate, keeping in mind our
          tools to manipulate the inidices of series.

          Let's rewrite this last equation in a slightly different
          form.
          <me>
            \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left[ c_{n+2}(n+2)(n+1) + c_n \right]

          We've just written the constant function <m>0</m> as a
          series. Now, two series are only equal is every coefficient
          is the same. Therefore, we can take this equation and turn
          it into an equation of coefficients. For every <m>n \in
          \NN</m>, we have a recurrence relation.
          <me>
            (n+1)(n+2)c_{n+2} + c_n = 0 \implies c_{n+2} =
            \frac{-c_n}{(n+1)(n+2)}
          </me>
          We'd like to solve this recurrence relation to get a easier
          decription of the series coefficients. Without any
          heavy-duty techniques for solving recurrence relations, we
          work by inspection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we start, we need two starting terms, <m>c_0</m> and
          <m>c_1</m>. This works out very well, since <m>c_0 =
          y(0)</m> and <m>c_1 = y^\prime(0)</m>. The initial seed
          terms for our recurrence relation are exactly initial
          conditions for the DE. We can either leave them as variables
          <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, or set them to specific values.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's set <m>c_0 = 1</m> and <m>c_1 = 0</m>. Then we use
          the recurrence relation to calculate some terms.

          After some of these terms, we can intuite the closed form.
          We put these terms into the series.

          This is exactly the Taylor series for cosine, which makes
          perfect sense, since cosine solves the original DE and
          matches the initial conditions we imposed.

          Expressing the coefficients in closed form is more difficult

        <p>
          We might wonder: what are these functions? These are two
          new, strange and unfamiliar functions. Unless we have the
          good fortune (as in the previous example) to recognize the
          resulting Taylor series, we simply treat the solutions as
          new functions. However, we still consider the DE solved,
          since we have Taylor series to define new functions. We
          know a great deal about a function based on its Taylor
          series, so this is a sufficient threshold of information to
          consider the DE solved.

          <m>0</m> is an ordinary point, but what is the distance to
          the nearest singular point? Here, we need to remember to
          look for singularities in <m>\CC</m>. The denominators are
          undefined at <m>\pm \imath</m>, which is 1 unit away from
          the origin. Therefore, centered at <m>0</m>, we expect a
          radius of <m>R=1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          (As an aside, note that we can centre the series wherever we
          wish; we default to <m>0</m> simply because it is convenient
          and familiar. Each choice of a center point gives a
          different series solution, with a different radius of
          convergence. At <m>t=1</m>, we would have <m>R=
          \sqrt{2}</m> (the distance to <m>\imath</m> in <m>\CC</m>).
          At <m>t=4</m>, we would have <m>R = \sqrt{17}</m>.)

          We have two cases. The odd terms all vanish, so the only
          place where we see <m>c_1</m> is the isolated term <m>c_1
          t</m>. That implies that the linear polynomial <m>c_1 t</m>
          is a solution for any <m>c_1</m>. For the <m>c_0</m> terms,
          we get a series. Putting this together gives the general
          solution. Note that we have to start the series at
          <m>n=2</m>, since the pattern doesn't hold before that
          point.

          If we look at the radius of convergence (due to the
          factorials on numerator and denominators) we can calculate
          the expected value of <m>R=1</m>. Note that the second
          term, the polynomial <m>c_1 t</m> doesn't have a domain
          restriction. It's possible to find solutions that exceed
          the limitation of the radius of convergence; <xref

          guaranteed a solution with a minimum radius of convergence
          but did not stipulate a maximum.
