      Consider a homogeneous linear second order differential equation.
      <me>
        y^{\prime \prime} + P(t) y^\prime + Q(t) y= 0
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      In a departure from the <xref ref="second-order-odes">Chapter</xref>,
      we will now allow <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> to be functions instead of just constants.
      Before we jump into the method of series solutions,
      we need some theory about the existence of solutions.

          A point <m>\alpha</m> is called an
          <term>ordinary point</term>
          for the differential equation if <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are both analytic at <m>\alpha</m>.
          Otherwise it is called a <term>singular point</term>.

        <p>
          If <m>\alpha</m> is an ordinary point of a linear homogeneous second order differential equation,
          the there exists two linearly independent analytic solutions centered at <m>\alpha</m>.
          These analytic solutions will have radii of convergence at least as large as the distance from <m>\alpha</m> to the nearest singular point of the DE.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      This is a lovley theorem, but these is one catch.
      The <sq>distance</sq> mentioned to the nearest singular point is actually distance in <m>\CC</m> to a possibly-complex singular point.
      In practice, this isn't too much of a worry,
      but we should be careful with our assumptions about the radii of convergence.

    <title>The Method for Solutions at Ordinary Points</title>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let's start with a simple and known DE, to see how the method works.
          <me>
            y^{\prime \prime} + y = 0
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Both <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are constant,
          so they analytic everywhere, even in <m>\CC</m>.
          Since there are no singular points,
          we expect solutions which have Taylor series defined for all of <m>\RR</m>.
          We can centre them at <m>0</m> for convenience.
          We assume the solution has a Taylor series.
          <me>
            y = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n t^n
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We put this into the DE and calcluate,
          keeping in mind our tools to manipulate the inidices of series.

        <p>
          Let's rewrite this last equation in a slightly different form.
          <me>
            \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left[ c_{n+2}(n+2)(n+1) + c_n \right] t^n = \sum_{n=0}^\infty 0 t^n
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We've just written the constant function <m>0</m> as a series.
          Now, two series are only equal is every coefficient is the same.
          Therefore, we can take this equation and turn it into an equation of coefficients.
          For every <m>n \in \NN</m>, we have a recurrence relation.
          <me>
            (n+1)(n+2)c_{n+2} + c_n = 0 \implies c_{n+2} = \frac{-c_n}{(n+1)(n+2)}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We'd like to solve this recurrence relation to get a easier decription of the series coefficients.
          Without any heavy-duty techniques for solving recurrence relations,
          we work by inspection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we start, we need two starting terms,
          <m>c_0</m> and <m>c_1</m>.
          This works out very well,
          since <m>c_0 = y(0)</m> and <m>c_1 = y^\prime(0)</m>.
          The initial seed terms for our recurrence relation are exactly initial conditions for the DE. We can either leave them as variables <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
          or set them to specific values.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's set <m>c_0 = 1</m> and <m>c_1 = 0</m>.
          Then we use the recurrence relation to calculate some terms.
          <md>
            <mrow>c_0 \amp  = 1</mrow>
            <mrow>c_1 \amp  = 0</mrow>

            <mrow>c_8 \amp  = \frac{-c_6}{(7)(8)} = \frac{1}{8!}</mrow>
            <mrow>c_9 \amp  = \frac{-c_7}{(8)(9)} = 0</mrow>
            <mrow>c_{2n} \amp  = \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n)!}</mrow>
            <mrow>c_{2n+1} \amp  = 0</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          After some of these terms, we can intuite the closed form.
          We put these terms into the series.
          <me>
            y = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n)!} t^{2n}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is exactly the Taylor series for cosine,
          which makes perfect sense,
          since cosine solves the original DE and matches the initial conditions we imposed.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          This is our first example which has non-constant coefficients,
          since <m>Q = t</m>.
          <me>
            y^{\prime \prime} + ty = 0
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>P=0</m> and <m>Q=t</m>, both of which are analytic everywhere,
          so we expect a series solution with infinite radius of convergence.
          We repeat the calculating from the previous example.

          As before, to match the homogeneous <m>=0</m>,
          we need all these coefficients to be zero.
          The second coefficient is isolated, so we have <m>c_2=0</m>.
          For the rest,
          we have <m>c_0</m> and <m>c_1</m> unknown and a recurrence relation.

          This is a third order recurrence relation.
          However, we still have only two parameters,
          due to the condition that <m>c_2=0</m>.
          We calculate the coefficients.

          We see that we have three groups of terms.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Terms of the form <m>c_{3n+2}</m> are all zero,
                since they all relate back to <m>c_2</m>.

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Terms of the form <m>c_{3n}</m> all involve <m>c_0</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Terms of the form <m>c_{3n+1}</m> all involve <m>c_1</m>.

            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Expressing the coefficients in closed form is more difficult than before,
          but we still can intuite the general form.
          We use some nice factorial tricks to express the coefficients.
          <md>
            <mrow>c_{3n} \amp  = \frac{(-1)^n (1)(4)(7)\ldots(3n-2)}{(3n)!} c_0</mrow>

          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we group the <m>c_1</m> terms into a series and the <m>c_2</m> terms into a series,
          to get a general solution.
          <me>
            y = c_0 \left[  1 + \sum_{n=n}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n (1)(4)(7)\ldots(3n-2)}{(3n)!} t^{3n} \right] + c_1 \left[ t + \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n (2)(5)(8)\ldots(n+2)}{(3n-1)!} t^{3n+1} \right]

        </p>
        <p>
          If we need to,
          we can easily check that each of these series has infinite radius of convergence.
        </p>
        <p>
          We might wonder: what are these functions?
          These are two new, strange and unfamiliar functions.
          Unless we have the good fortune
          (as in the previous example)
          to recognize the resulting Taylor series,
          we simply treat the solutions as new functions.
          However, we still consider the DE solved,
          since we have Taylor series to define new functions.
          We know a great deal about a function based on its Taylor series,
          so this is a sufficient threshold of information to consider the DE solved.

          <m>0</m> is an ordinary point,
          but what is the distance to the nearest singular point?
          Here, we need to remember to look for singularities in <m>\CC</m>.
          The denominators are undefined at <m>\pm \imath</m>,
          which is 1 unit away from the origin.
          Therefore, centered at <m>0</m>,
          we expect a radius of <m>R=1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          (As an aside,
          note that we can centre the series wherever we wish;
          we default to <m>0</m> simply because it is convenient and familiar.
          Each choice of a center point gives a different series solution,
          with a different radius of convergence.
          At <m>t=1</m>, we would have <m>R= \sqrt{2}</m>
          (the distance to <m>\imath</m> in <m>\CC</m>).

          We have two cases.
          The odd terms all vanish,
          so the only place where we see <m>c_1</m> is the isolated term <m>c_1 t</m>.
          That implies that the linear polynomial <m>c_1 t</m> is a solution for any <m>c_1</m>.
          For the <m>c_0</m> terms, we get a series.
          Putting this together gives the general solution.
          Note that we have to start the series at <m>n=2</m>,
          since the pattern doesn't hold before that point.
          <me>
            y = c_0 \left[1 + \frac{t^2}{2} + \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{((-1)^n (2n-3)!}{2^{2n-2} n! (n-2)!} \right] + c_1 t

          If we look at the radius of convergence
          (due to the factorials on numerator and denominators)
          we can calculate the expected value of <m>R=1</m>.
          Note that the second term,
          the polynomial <m>c_1 t</m> doesn't have a domain restriction.
          It's possible to find solutions that exceed the limitation of the radius of convergence;
          <xref ref="thm-series-solutions-existence">Theorem</xref>
          guaranteed a solution with a minimum radius of convergence but did not stipulate a maximum.
