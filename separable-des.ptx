  <title>Separable Equations</title>

    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>separable equation</term> is a DE which has the
        following form, for some expressions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>.
        <me>
          \frac{dy}{dt} = f(y) g(t)
        </me>
        The key idea in the definition is that all the parts involving
        the dependent variable can be separated into on piece which is
        then multiplied by a second piece containing only the
        independent variable. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <me>
        \frac{dy}{dt} = \left( y^2 + 2y - 1 \right) \left(
        \frac{1}{t^2 +1} \right) 
      </me>
      is a separable equation. On the right side, there are two
      expressions, one only involving <m>y</m> and one only involving
      <m>t</m>, which are multiplied together. 
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <me>
        \frac{dy}{dt} = \sin y \left( e^{t^2 + 1} - t^2 \right) 
      </me>
      is a separable equation. On the right side, there are two
      expressions, one only involving <m>y</m> and one only involving
      <m>t</m>, which are multiplied together. 
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <me>
        \frac{dy}{dt} = ty + t^2 y^2 + t^3 y^3 
      </me>
      is not a separable equation, since there is no way to factor the
      right side into two multiplied expressions <m>f(y) g(t)</m>.
      Even though each piece of the sum on right side has this form,
      the entire right side needs to be factorable this way to satisfy
      the definition. 
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    Separable equations are the first type of differential equation
    that we will actually solve in this course. They have a universal
    method (at least, a long as we can make sense of the resulting
    integrals.) First, I will take the expression involving the
    dependent variable and bring it to the left side. (I have to worry
    a bit about values of <m>y</m> that have <m>g(y) = 0</m>, but I'll
    worry about that issue in a later section.) 
    <me>
      \frac{1}{f(y)} \frac{dy}{dt} = g(t)
    </me>
    Since <m>y</m> is the dependent variable, the assumption all
    though is that <m>y</m> is some function of <m>t</m>. This means
    that both sides of the equations are functions of <m>t</m>; the
    left side implicity and the right side explicitly. Therefore, I'll
    integrate both sides in <m>t</m>.
    <me>
      \int \frac{1}{f(y)} \frac{dy}{dt} dt  = \int g(t) dt
    </me>
    Now I use a strange looking substitution <m>y = y(t)</m> on the
    left side of the integral. The differential piece of the
    substitution is <m>dy = \frac{dy}{dt} dt</m>, which convenience
    replaces a big piece of the left side integral. 
    <me>
      \int \frac{1}{f(y)} dy = \int g(t) dt  
    </me>
    To finish, I do both the integrals. The result is some function of
    <m>y</m> on the left and some function of <m>t</m> on the right.
    If I can, I simplify to solve for <m>y</m> along on the left,
    which gives <m>y</m> as a function of <m>t</m> as desired. The
    function will include a  constant of integration that arises from
    the integration step as well. If I cannot solve for <m>y</m>, I
    can leave the solution implicit. Even if I can solve for <m>y</m>,
    often the implicit for is preferred. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I should make one note about the constant on integration that
    arises in this solution method (and in many other as well). Since
    the constant of integraiton will eventually be determined by an
    initial value, mathematicians are often quite careless with the
    artihmetic of this constant. For example, if the following
    expression shows up <m>2(t+c)</m>, I would often simplify this to
    <m>2t+c</m> instead of <m>2t + 2c</m>, since whether we figure out
    the constant from <m>c</m> or from <m>2c</m> later, its value is
    still determined by the initial condition. This is a strange
    carelessness after all the care mathematicians have always
    preaches about arithmetic and algebra, but it is, in fact,
    justified.

        It is interesting to note where the constant of integration
        ends up. Since integration isn't the final step (we have to
        also solve for <m>y</m>), the constant moves around in the
        resulting algebra. In DEs, I can't just add <m>+c</m> at the
        very end of the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I impose an initial condition of <m>y(0) = 1</m>,
        I can determined the value of the constant of integration and
        thus a unique solution.

        graphs. Notice the strange domain issues with this implicit
        plot. When <m>|c| \leq 2</m>, the solutions have a restricted
        domain, represented by the closed curves. There are no
        solutions at all when <m>c \lt -2</m>. There are solutions
        with domain <m>\RR</m> only for <m>c \geq 2</m>. When <m>c =
        2</m>, the solution is the crossed graph, which is not always
        differentiable. When <m>c=-2</m>. the <sq>solution</sq> is
        only defined at discrete points.

        Here is a separable DE, which I solve with the method
        described above, separating the variables, integrating both
        sides, and solving for the dependent variable. This is an
        autonomous example, so the right side integral is trivial.

        Since this is an autonomous equation, I should look for steady
        singular solutions when the right side of the equation
        vanishes. On the graph, the steady state solutions should be
        horizontal lines, since the function never changes. Here,
        <m>y=2</m> and <m>y=-2</m> are steady states. Moreover,
        <m>y=2</m> is stable and <m>y=-2</m> is unstable. This can be
        seen in the direction field in <xref
        ref="figure-direction-field7" /> and the graphs of some
        solution curves in <xref ref="figure-direction-field7-curves"
        />. Near the stable steady state, the solutions go towards the
        horizontal line. Near the unstable steady state, the solutions
        go away from the horizontal line.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also interesting to note that the output of <m>\tanh</m>
        is only <m>-1</m> to <m>1</m>, so it is impossible to get <m>y
        \leq -2</m> or <m>y \geq 2</m>. I might wonder if there are
        solutions in this range at all. In the implicit plot, I could
        draw curves with these <m>y</m> values, since there are slopes
        in that part of the cartesian plane. These other curves can
        be found by doing the integral differently, since both
        hyperbolic tangent and hyperbolic cotangent have the same
        anti-derivative. <m>y=2 \coth (-2t + c)</m> is also a
        solution.
